<p class="dropcap">It is the middle of July, but the
London season has not, as yet,
shown any symptoms of being
on the wane, and the drawing-room
of the Honourable Mrs Carnaby-Hicks
is arranged for the reception of
visitors. Curtains of guipure lace, looped
with pale-blue ribbons, shroud every
window, purple irises and yellow jonquils
as displayed in art needlework, adorn
each chair and sofa; fanciful little tables
of silk and velvet, laden with Sevres and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Dresden china are placed in everybody’s
way, and a powerful odour of hot-house
flowers pervades the apartment. A double
knock sounds at the door, and the Honourable
Mrs Carnaby-Hicks starts from the
dose into which she has fallen, and seizing
a novel, sits upright, and pretends that
she is deep in its contents. But she need
not have been so punctilious, for the footman,
throwing open the door, announces
her brother, Mr Tresham. Roland enters
the room, looking fagged, dusty, and out
of sorts, a complete contrast to the dainty
adornments of his sister’s drawing-room.</p>

<p>‘Well, Roland!’ exclaims Mrs Carnaby-Hicks,
‘and what is your news? It is
an age since we have seen you! I was
beginning to think you must have made
away with yourself.’</p>

<p>‘No such luck,’ replies her brother,
moodily, ‘though I believe it would be
the best thing that I could do.’</p>

<p>He is a handsome man of only thirty
years of age, but the look of care upon
his brow makes him appear older. His
dress is not exactly shabby, but it is the
dress of a needy gentleman, and did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
issue from the tailor’s hands this season,
nor even last.</p>

<p>‘How are you all at home?’ continues
the lady.</p>

<p>‘Just the same as usual; a medley of
dirt, ill-management, and unpunctuality!
I dread to enter the house.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! Roland, it is too late to advise
you now, but that marriage was the worst
day’s work you ever did. Not thirty till
September, and with a wife and six children
on your hands. It is a terrible
misfortune!’</p>

<p>‘And two hundred a-year on which to
support them,’ laughs Mr Tresham, bitterly.
‘Don’t speak of it, Valeria, unless
you wish to drive me mad. And to add
to my troubles I have just received this
letter;’ tossing it over to her.</p>

<p>‘Who is it from?’</p>

<p>‘Lady Tresham! Her generosity seems
to be on a par with his! You see how she
writes me word that Sir Ralph is in Switzerland
mountain-climbing with Handley
Harcourt, but that if he were at home she
fears he would be unlikely to comply with
my request.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>‘Did you ask Ralph for money then?’</p>

<p>‘Not as a gift. I wrote to him for a
loan of fifty pounds, to carry on the war,
but of course I should regard it as a debt.
The fact is, Valeria, I don’t know where to
look for money; my profession brings me
in nothing, and we cannot live on the
miserable pittance my father left me. It
is simply impossible!’</p>

<p>If Roland Tresham has entertained any
hope that, on hearing of his difficulty, his
rich sister will offer to lend or give him the
money, which would be a trifle out of her
pocket, he has reckoned without his host.
She likes Roland in her way, and is always
pleased to see him in her house, but the
woman and the children may starve for
aught she will do to help them. She considers
them only in the light of a burthen
and disgrace.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see why you shouldn’t live on
two hundred a-year,’ she answers shortly.
‘Of course it is very little, but if your wife
were worth her salt she would make you
comfortable on it. But that is what comes
of marrying a beauty. They’re seldom
good for anything else.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>‘There’s not much beauty left about
Juliet now,’ replies Roland Tresham, ‘but
I don’t think it is entirely her fault. The
children worry her so, she has no energy
left to do anything.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a miserable plight to be in,’ sighs
the Honourable Mrs Carnaby-Hicks, ‘and
I can see how it tells upon your health
and spirits. What do you propose to do?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Do!</i> I should like to hang myself.
Do you think there is any chance, Valeria,
of your husband getting me a foreign
appointment? I don’t care where it is.
I would go out to the Fiji Islands, or Timbuctoo,
or to the devil himself, to get away
from it all.’</p>

<p>‘And leave them at home?’ says Mrs
Carnaby-Hicks.</p>

<p>‘Yes! Juliet should have the two hundred,
and I would keep myself. Perhaps
if she had only the children to look after,
she might get on better. And the happiest
thing for me would be, never to return!’</p>

<p>‘I will ask Mr Carnaby-Hicks about it,’
replies his sister. ‘If it is to be done at
all, it must be before Parliament is prorogued.
But I wouldn’t lose all hope with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
regard to Ralph on account of Lady Tresham’s
letter. When he returns he can
hardly refuse to lend you such a trifling
sum as fifty pounds.’</p>

<p>It does not seem to occur to her that
she would miss the money as little as Sir
Ralph himself.</p>

<p>‘I shall not ask him a second time,’
says Roland, ‘nor Lady Tresham either.
They may keep their money to themselves.
But how a father can justify to himself the
fact of leaving ten thousand a-year to one
son, and two hundred to the other, beats
me altogether!’</p>

<p>‘The money must go with the baronetcy,’
remarks his sister coolly, ‘and your portion
was only intended to supplement your professional
income. You ought to have made
a competency by this time, Roland. You
would have done so, had you not hampered
yourself in such a reckless manner!’</p>

<p>At this moment the conversation is
interrupted by the entrance of a young
lady, dressed in the height of the reigning
fashion.</p>

<p>‘My husband’s niece, Miss Mabel
Moore,’ says Mrs Carnaby-Hicks, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
then extending a hand to the girl, she
draws her forward. ‘Mabel, dear, this
is my younger brother, of whom you have
heard me speak. Ring the bell and let
us have tea. Roland and I have had a
long conversation, and I feel quite fatigued.’</p>

<p>Roland Tresham stares at his new acquaintance
with unmitigated surprise. Miss
Moore is a tall, dark girl with a commanding
figure, clad in a pale, cream-coloured
dress that fits it like a skin. Her rounded
arms, her well-developed bust and shapely
waist are as distinctly displayed as if the
material had been strained across them;
and the uninitiated Roland gazes at her in
astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Such a sweet girl,’ whispers Mrs Carnaby-Hicks
to him, as Mabel quits her
side; ‘I love her as if she were my
daughter. As soon as the season is
over, Mr Carnaby-Hicks and I are going
to take her for a tour in Italy. And, by
the way, Roland, could you not manage
to accompany us? A second gentleman
would be a great acquisition on the journey,
and you would be invaluable to Mabel and
me as a <i>cicerone</i>. Do come!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>‘You might as well talk of my going to
the moon, Valeria. I should enjoy it
above all things, but it is impossible.
Only fancy the delight though of change
of scene and air and freedom from all the
horrors of Camden Town. It would be like
a taste of Heaven to me!’</p>

<p>‘I am sure you could manage it if you
tried! Come here, Mabel, and persuade
my brother to join us in our trip to
Italy.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Mr Tresham, <i>do</i> come,’ says
Mabel, throwing a glance at him from a
pair of dark, languishing eyes. ‘It will
double Aunt Valeria’s pleasure to have
your company.’</p>

<p>Roland Tresham has not, as a rule, admired
dark eyes in women nor commanding
figures. His wife is very fair, and
slight and fragile in appearance, and when
he married her eight years before, he
thought her the loveliest creature God
ever made. But as Mabel Moore casts
her black-lashed eyes upon him, he feels
a very strong desire to join the travelling
party to Italy.</p>

<p>‘You hold out powerful temptations to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
me, Miss Moore,’ he answers, ‘but it is too
important a matter to be settled in a
day. But if I <i>can</i> go, you may be sure I
will.’</p>

<p>And then he falls to wondering whether
Mrs Carnaby-Hicks intends her offer to
be taken as an invitation, and means to
defray his expenses. For she must know
he has no money to pay them himself.
Meanwhile Miss Moore pours out his tea,
and hands it to him in a porcelain cup with
the most gracious and encouraging of
smiles. It is a strange contrast to the
man who knows what he will encounter
on reaching home, to be seated among all
the refinement of his sister’s drawing-room,
sipping the most fragrant Pekoe from a
costly piece of china, whilst he is waited
on by a handsome woman clad in a cream-coloured
skin, every fold of the train of
which shakes out the essence of a subtle
perfume. He revels in it whilst it lasts,
though after a while he rises with a sudden
sigh of recollection, and says he must be
going home.</p>

<p>‘Don’t forget to ask Hicks about the
appointment,’ he whispers to his sister as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
he takes his leave. ‘Remember, I will
take anything and go anywhere just to get
away from this.’</p>

<p>‘Very good,’ she answers, ‘and don’t
<i>you</i> forget that we expect you to be one of
our party to Italy.’</p>

<p>‘Yes! indeed,’ echoes Mabel with a
parting glance, ‘I shall not enjoy my trip
at all now, unless Mr Tresham goes with
us!’</p>

<p>‘What a good-looking fellow!’ she exclaims
as soon as the door has closed
behind him. ‘Aunty! why did you never
tell me what he was like?’</p>

<p>‘My dear child, where was the use of
talking of him? The unfortunate man is
married, and has no money. Had he been
rich and a bachelor, it would have been a
different thing!’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know that,’ says Miss Mabel,
‘for my part I prefer married men to flirt
with; they’re so safe. Besides, it’s such
fun making the wives jealous.’</p>

<p>‘It would take a great deal to make Mrs
Tresham jealous,’ says the elder lady.
‘They’re past all that, my dear. So you
can flirt with Roland to your heart’s content,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
only don’t go too far. Remember
Lord Ernest Freemantle!’</p>

<p>‘Bother Lord Ernest,’ returns the
fashionable young lady in precisely the same
tone as she would have used the stronger
word had she been of the stronger sex.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the gentleman is going home
by train to Camden Town: a locality which
he has chosen, not on account of its convenience,
but because he can rent a house
there for the modest sum of thirty pounds
a-year. His immediate neighbours are
bankers’ clerks, milliners, and petty tradesmen
from the West End, but the brother
of Sir Ralph Tresham of Tresham Court,
and the Honourable Mrs Carnaby-Hicks,
of 120 Blue Street, Mayfair, has no alternative
but to reside amongst them. He has
chosen a profession in which he has signally
failed, and has hampered himself
with a wife and six children, when his
private means are not sufficient to support
himself. He fancies he can hear his
children shouting even before he has
gained the little terrace in which they
reside. They are all so abominably strong
and healthy: their voices will reach to any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
distance. And as he comes in sight of the
familiar spot, his suspicions turn to certainties.
Wilfrid and Bertie and Fred,
three sturdy rascals with faces surrounded
by aureoles of golden hair like angels’
crowns, but plastered with dirt like the
very lowest of human creatures, are hanging
on to the palings which enclose a patch
of chickweed and dandelions in front of
the house, and shouting offensive epithets
to every passer-by.</p>

<p>‘Can’t you keep inside and behave yourselves?
How often have I ordered you
not to hang about the garden in this way?’
exclaims Roland Tresham, as he cuffs the
little urchins right and left. The two youngest
rush for protection to their mother,
howling, whilst the eldest sobs out,—</p>

<p>‘Mamma said we might play here.’</p>

<p>‘Then your mother’s as great a fool as
you are,’ replies the father, angrily, as he
strides into the house.</p>

<p>Juliet Tresham is waiting to receive him,
with a deep frown upon her brow. Any
unprejudiced observer would see at a glance
that she is a lovely woman, but it is the
loveliness of beauty unadorned. Her luxuriant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
golden hair is all pushed off her face,
and strained into a tight knot at the back
of her head. Her large blue eyes are dull
and languid; her lips are colourless, and
her ill-fitting, home-made dress hangs awkwardly
upon her figure. In her husband’s
eyes, all her beauty and her grace have
faded long ago. He associates her with
nothing now, but weak lungs and spirits,
squalling children, badly-cooked dinners,
and an untidy home. It is scarcely to be
wondered at that she does not smile him a
welcome home.</p>

<p>‘You might inquire whether the children
are in the right or wrong, before you hit
them,’ she says sharply. ‘I told them they
might play in the front garden.’</p>

<p>‘Then they must suffer for your folly, for
I won’t have them hanging about the place
like a set of beggars’ brats.’</p>

<p>‘It’s all very fine for you to talk, but
what am I to do with them cooped up in
the house, on a day like this? If you had
the charge of them, you’d turn them out
anywhere, just to get rid of them.’</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you let the girl look after
them?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>‘“<i>The girl!</i>” That’s just how you men
talk! As if one wretched girl of fourteen
had not enough to do to keep the house
clean, and cook the dinner, without taking
charge of half-a-dozen children!’</p>

<p>‘Oh! well, don’t bother me about it.
Am I to have any dinner to-day or not?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose Ann will bring it up when it
is ready,’ says his wife indifferently; ‘you
can’t expect to be waited on as if you were
the owner of Tresham Court.’</p>

<p>‘D—n you! I wish you’d hold your
tongue!’ he answers angrily.</p>

<p>He calls it his dinner, for the good
reason that it is the only dinner he ever
gets, but it is a wretched mockery of the
meal.</p>

<p>‘What do you call this?’ he says, as he
examines the untempting-looking viands,
and views with disgust the evident traces
of black fingers on the edge of the dish.
‘Take it away, and serve it me on a clean
plate. I may be obliged to swallow any
dog’s meat you chose to put before me, but
I’ll be hanged if I’ll eat the smuts off your
servant’s hands as well.’</p>

<p>Mrs Tresham, who is occupied at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
other end of the table in cutting slices of
bread and salt butter for the tribe of little
cormorants by which she is surrounded,
just turns her head and calls through the
open door to the maid-of-all-work in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>‘Ann, come and fetch away this dish;
your master says it is dirty.’</p>

<p>‘Do it yourself!’ roars her exasperated
husband. ‘It is quite bad enough that
you are so lazy, you won’t look after any
of my comforts in my absence, without
your refusing to set matters right now.’</p>

<p>His wife takes up the dish in silence, and
leaves the apartment, whereupon two of
the children, disappointed of their bread
and butter, begin to cry. Roland Tresham,
after threatening to turn them out of the
room if they do not hold their tongues,
leaves his seat and leans out of the open
window, disconsolately. What a position
it is in which to find his father’s son!
Outside, his neighbours are sitting in their
shirt sleeves, smoking clay pipes in their
strips of garden, or hanging over the railings
talking with one another; in the road
itinerant merchants are vending radishes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
onions, and shellfish; whilst a strong, warm
smell is wafted right under his nostrils from
the pork-pie shop round the corner. Inside,
the children are whimpering for the
return of their mother round a soiled table-cloth
which bears a piece of salt butter,
warm and melting, a jar of treacle with a
knife stuck in it, a stale loaf, a metal teapot,
and knives and forks which have been
but half-cleaned. A vision comes over
Roland of that art-decorated drawing-room
in Blue Street, with the porcelain tea-service,
the silken clad figure, and the
subtle perfume that pervaded the scene;
and a great longing for all the delicacies
and refinements of life comes over him,
with a proportionate disgust for his surroundings.
When his wife returns with
the beefsteak, he pushes it from him. His
appetite has vanished with the delay.</p>

<p>‘I can’t eat it,’ he says impatiently.
‘Take the filth away.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s the best I can do for you,’ is
her reply. ‘It’s quite enough for a woman
to be nurse and housemaid, without turning
cook into the bargain.’</p>

<p>‘It is a long time since I have expected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
you to do anything to please me, Juliet;
however, stop the mouths of those brats of
yours, and send them to bed. I want the
room to myself. I have work which must
be done this evening.’</p>

<p>She supplies the children’s wants, and
hurries them from the room, whilst her
husband sits sulking and dreaming of Blue
Street. If his brother-in-law can only get
him a foreign appointment, how gladly he
will fly from this squalid home for ever.
He pictures a life by the shores of the
Mediterranean, in the forests of Brazil, on
the plains of India, or the Australian
colonies, and each and every one seems a
paradise compared with that which he leads
at present.</p>

<p>Mrs Tresham, putting her little ones to
rest, feels also that, except for them, she
would lay down her existence. She is
utterly sick and wearied of her life. She is
almost cross with Wilfrid and Bertie and
Fred, because they will bolster one another,
instead of lying down in their cots and
going to sleep like pattern boys. For
Baby Roland is whimpering for the breast,
and two-year-old May is fractious with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
pain of cutting her double teeth. Lily,
her mother’s help and companion, is the
only one that waits patiently until her turn
arrives to be undressed. But when the
rest are at last subdued, or satisfied, and
Juliet Tresham turns to attend to her
eldest daughter, her trembling fingers have
busied themselves but for a few seconds
with strings and buttons, before her arms
are cast around the child, and she bursts
into a storm of tears.</p>

<p>‘Mamma, why do you cry?’ asks Lily
anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Lily, Lily! It is not my fault—it
is not my fault.’</p>

<p>God help her, poor Juliet, it is not!
Almost a girl in years, yet laden with cares
such as few wives in her position are ever
called upon to bear, she has sunk beneath
the weight of an overwhelming load.
Health and energy have failed her, and
her husband’s patience has not proved
equal to the occasion, and so irritability
and discontent have crept in on the one
hand, and disgust and indifference on the
other. And yet they loved each other
once, oh! so dearly, and believed from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
their hearts they would have died sooner
than give up their mutual affection.</p>

<p>But Mrs Tresham does not cry long.
She persuades herself that the man downstairs
is not worth crying for.</p>

<p>‘Get into bed, Lily, darling, or papa
will be coming up to see what we are
about.’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t kiss papa nor wish him good-night,’
says the child.</p>

<p>‘No, no! it doesn’t signify. He doesn’t
care for your kisses, nor for mine.’</p>

<p>She tucks her little girl into her bed
and descends to the sitting-room again,
feeling injured and hard of heart. Roland,
as she enters, glances at her with a look
of disgust.</p>

<p>‘Your hair is half way down your back.’</p>

<p>She laughs slightly, and, pulling out the
fastenings of her hair, lets the rippling
mass fall over her shoulders. Roland used
to admire it so much in the days gone by,
and say it was the only gold he cared to
possess. Has she any hope that he will
recall his former feelings at the sight of
her loosely falling locks? If so, she is
mistaken, for he only remarks coldly,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>‘I must beg you not to turn my room
into a dressing-room. Go and put your
hair up tidily. I hate to find it amongst
my papers.’</p>

<p>‘I believe you hate everything except
your own comfort,’ she replies. ‘You’re
the most selfish man I ever came across.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps so! But as long as this house
belongs to me, you’ll be good enough to
keep your opinions to yourself. If I can’t
have comfort when I come home, I will at
least have peace.’</p>

<p>‘And much peace <i>I</i> get, day or night.’</p>

<p>‘It is by your own mismanagement if
you do not.’</p>

<p>‘How do you make that out? Has
your want of money anything to do with
my mismanagement? Have the children
anything to do with it? You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Ought I?’ he returns, biting his lip.
‘Then, perhaps, you’ll be glad to hear that
I have applied for a foreign appointment
that will take me out to India, or the
Brazils, for the remainder of my life.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Roland!’ she cries, catching her
breath; ‘but not to leave us?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>‘Certainly to leave you. That was the
sole object of my application. Aren’t you
delighted to hear it? We lead a cat-and-dog
life as things are at present, and the
sooner we are separated the better.’</p>

<p>‘But the children—and <i>me</i>!’ she gasps,
with a face of chalky whiteness.</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t be afraid! you will be provided
for.’</p>

<p>‘But if you should be ill?’ suggests the
woman fearfully.</p>

<p>‘Then I shall die, perhaps, and so much
the better. You have not made my life
such a heaven to me that I shall lose
much by its resignation.’</p>

<p>Then she falls upon his neck, weeping.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Roland, Roland! do not speak to
me like that.’</p>

<p>But he pushes her from him. He has
had no dinner, and that is a trial that never
improves the masculine temper.</p>

<p>‘Don’t make a fool of yourself!’ he says
roughly.</p>

<p>Juliet raises her head and dries her eyes.
She is a proud woman and a high-spirited
one, and never disposed to take a rebuff
meekly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>‘I <i>am</i> a fool,’ she answers. ‘Any
woman would be a fool who wasted a
regret upon such an icicle as you are. I
hope to Heaven you may get your appointment
and go out to the Brazils, and never
come back again; for the less I see and
hear of you the better.’</p>

<p>‘Just what I said,’ remarks her husband
indifferently. ‘You are as sick of me as
I am of you, and it’s of no use disguising
the truth from one another.’</p>

<p>‘There <i>was</i> a time when you thought
nothing too good to say of me,’ she cries,
hysterically.</p>

<p>‘Was there? Well, you can’t expect
such things to last for ever, and you have
really made my life such a hell to me of
late that you can’t be surprised if I look
forward to any change as a blessing.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! It has come to that, has it—that
you want to get rid of me? Why
don’t you put the finishing stroke to your
cruelty and say at once that you hate
me?’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid you are making me do
something very much like it.’</p>

<p>‘The truth is, you are tired of me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Roland! It is nursing your children and
trying out of our scanty income to provide
for your wants that has brought me down
to what I am, and since I have ceased to
please your eyes, I have wearied out your
fancy.’</p>

<p>‘Yes! my dear,’ he says, with provoking
nonchalance. ‘You are quite right; I <i>am</i>
very tired of you, and particularly at this
moment. Suppose you leave me to my
writing, and go to bed.’</p>

<p>Mrs Tresham rushes from the little
room and slams the door behind her. But
she does not go to bed. She takes a seat
amongst her sleeping children, and, resting
her head upon her hands, weeps for the
past which is slumbering like them, although
she thinks it dead. It is just nine
o’clock, and as the hour strikes from a
neighbouring church tower, she sees the
postman coming up the street. He enters
the <i>parterre</i> of chickweed and dandelions,
and gives a double knock at the front door,
whilst Mrs Tresham, sitting at her bedroom
window, wonders vaguely who the
letter can be from. But presently she
hears a shout from below—a mingled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
shout of surprise and horror and excitement,
and startled and curious she runs
downstairs to learn the cause.</p>

<p>Her husband’s handsome face—flushed
and animated—turns towards her as she
opens the door.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter?’ she exclaims
hurriedly.</p>

<p>‘<i>What is the matter?</i>’ he repeats.
‘What is <i>not</i> the matter? My God! can
it possibly be true?’</p>

<p>He has leapt from his seat and passed
his fingers through his hair, which is all
on end. His eyes flame like living fire;
his whole frame is trembling; she thinks
for the moment that he has gone mad.</p>

<p>‘Roland, you are frightening me terribly!
Have you had bad news?’</p>

<p>‘Bad news! No. Glorious news! At
least I suppose I ought not to call it so,
because he’s my brother, but he has never
been like a brother to me. Juliet! Only
fancy—Ralph is dead, killed by a fall down
the mountain side.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Poor Sir Ralph! How terrible!
But perhaps it is not true.’</p>

<p>‘It <i>is</i> true. This letter is from Lady<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Tresham’s nephew, Handley Harcourt,
who was with Ralph at the time of his
death. And they are bringing the body to
England. And—and—can’t you understand?
<i>I</i> am Sir Roland Tresham, of
Tresham Court—with ten thousand a-year
to keep it up on, and—Oh, my God!—my
God! I believe the news will drive
me mad.’</p>

<p>He casts himself face downwards on the
rickety couch in the corner of the room,
and sobs as if, without that relief, his heart
would burst with joy. Meanwhile his wife
stands motionless, almost unable to comprehend
the sudden change in their condition,
until her husband starts up again,
exclaiming,—</p>

<p>‘What a child I am. But it only proves
what I have suffered. To be free, once
and for ever, of all this struggling and
starvation—to see my poor children placed
in the position to which they were born—It
is too great a change to be believed in,
all at once. My boys shall enter the
army and navy—and my girls have every
advantage my wealth can procure them.
Oh, it is too much! It has all happened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
so suddenly. I feel as if I should die
before I come into it. Sir Roland Tresham,
of Tresham Court! Sir Roland Tresham,
of Tresham Court! Merciful heavens, am
I awake or in a dream?’</p>

<p>He has never mentioned his wife whilst
enumerating the advantages his new fortune
will bring him. He has never once
congratulated himself on the fact that <i>she</i>
will no longer be obliged to slave and work
and deny herself as she has been used to
do. All he thinks of are the children and
himself.</p>

<p>‘When will you come into all this,
Roland?’ she asks.</p>

<p>‘I am it now! I was the Baronet from
the moment of my poor brother’s death.’</p>

<p>‘And shall we go to Tresham Court
soon?’</p>

<p>‘Directly the funeral is over. I shall
see the lawyers and Valeria the first thing
in the morning, and know all about it.
But I would rather you went upstairs
and left me alone. I must have time to
become accustomed to the idea of this
wonderful transformation scene. By to-morrow
morning I shall be all right.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Good-night! Good-night! There will be
no more trouble about money now. And
Sir Wilfrid shall be at Eton before he
knows what he is about. By Jove! How
marvellously things do come round.’</p>

<p>He nods her a careless farewell in an
excited sort of manner, and the new Lady
Tresham creeps up to her bed and takes
baby Roland in her arms, and sobs herself
to sleep with his chubby face pressed
close against her bosom.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">‘Now you will be able to take
that trip to Italy with us,’ says
the Honourable Mrs Carnaby-Hicks
a few days later, as Sir
Roland and she sit in the artistic drawing-room
in Blue Street together. The funeral
of the late baronet is over—and the new
one is installed in his stead. Lady Tresham
and the children are already at the
Court, and Sir Roland has come up to
town to see his sister. ‘You can come to
Italy with us,’ repeats Mrs Carnaby-Hicks.
‘You are sadly in need of rest and change,
and it will do you all the good in the world.
You will find our dear Mabel a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
charming companion, and I am sure you
have earned the right to take a holiday!’</p>

<p>‘I should enjoy it above all things,’
replies Sir Roland, as he glances at Miss
Moore. ‘But do you think it would be
advisable. Shall I not be expected to
take up my residence at Tresham Court,
at all events for a while?’</p>

<p>‘Not a bit of it! I hope you are not
going to make yourself a slave to your
position. Besides, from what you tell me,
I should imagine it will be all the better
for Lady Tresham to get a little accustomed
to housekeeping before you rejoin
her. She must need practice.’</p>

<p>Sir Roland lifts his hands deprecatingly.</p>

<p>‘Heaven help my guests if she doesn’t
improve! But there seems to be an excellent
staff of servants down there, and the
majority will remain with us. And it would
be so delightful to get away from it all. I
thirst to leave the remembrance of the
past entirely behind me—when do you
start, Valeria?’</p>

<p>‘The day after to-morrow!’</p>

<p>‘That is sharp work. I shall hardly
have time to do my business here and run<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
down to Tresham Court and back again in
a couple of days.’</p>

<p>‘Why go down to the Court? There
will only be a scene if you do. Write and
tell Lady Tresham of your intention.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Sir Roland, I shall <i>never</i> forgive
you if you cry off now,’ interposes Mabel.
‘You know it was a bargain that you
should go with us if you could. And
aunty means to take Venice on our way.
Fancy Venice and gondolas in this
heavenly weather! It will be <i>too</i> delicious.’</p>

<p>Gondolas and Mabel Moore win the
day, and Sir Roland agrees to write to
his wife instead of going down to Tresham
Court.</p>

<p>‘Now, you are quite, <i>quite</i> sure you
are not telling us a story,’ says Miss
Moore, with a winning smile, ‘because I
know if you go home that Lady Tresham
will not let you return to us again. You
<i>promise</i> only to write, don’t you?’</p>

<p>‘I <i>promise</i>!’ repeats Sir Roland, with
an uneasy twinge of conscience nevertheless.
But he keeps his word, and a letter
by the next day’s post informs Juliet that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
her husband is going to visit Italy with
his sister, and that she must manage
matters at Tresham Court as best she
can until his return. This intelligence
falls upon the wife like a sudden blow.
She feels very strange and awkward as
the mistress of this great rambling house,
with its retinue of servants, but she has
been seizing the opportunity of Sir Roland’s
absence to try and become acquainted
with the <i>ménage</i> of the kitchen
and the housekeeper’s room, that she may
astonish him with her aptitude on his
return. And now he is going to leave
her to fight with all her new responsibilities
alone, whilst he is enjoying a trip
upon the Continent. Well, she will not
be so mean spirited a creature as to sit
down and weep for his absence. She
will show him that she can enjoy life as
well as himself when she has the means
to do so. Yet the tears chase themselves
rapidly down her cheeks as she thinks
thus to herself, for Lady Tresham has
two nurses now to look after her children,
and can afford to indulge her feelings without
spectators. It is a bright sunny morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
in the first week of August; the grounds
of Tresham Court are filled with beautiful
flowers and leafy trees and singing birds,
and the pale-faced, weary woman takes
her husband’s letter in her hand, and seats
herself beneath the shade of a cedar tree
on the smooth green lawn, and indulges
her sorrowful thoughts to their fullest
extent.</p>

<p>Presently she hears a soft voice calling
her by name. She looks up in surprise;
beside her stands an elderly lady, dressed
in widow’s weeds.</p>

<p>‘Your servants said you were not at
home, Lady Tresham, but I caught a
glimpse of your dress through the trees,
and hoped you would not deem it a
liberty if I introduced myself to you as
the widow of your husband’s brother.’</p>

<p>‘Lady Tresham!’ cries Juliet, springing
to her feet. ‘I am glad to see you, but I
am very untidy; I did not expect any one
to call to-day. I did not even know that
you were in the county.’</p>

<p>‘I have a house of my own about five
miles from here, but I only returned to
it yesterday. And so you are really Sir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Roland’s wife. Why, you are a mere
girl.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, you are mistaken. It is a long
time since I was a girl. I am twenty-six!’</p>

<p>‘And I am twenty years older than
yourself, so you see I have a right to
consider you a girl. But you have been
crying. Surely you have no trouble now.
I thought all your troubles lay in the want
of means.’</p>

<p>‘We <i>were</i> very, very poor,’ says Juliet,
with proud simplicity, ‘and I am hardly
accustomed to the use of money yet. But
I was crying—it is very foolish of me, I
know, but I cannot help it—because my
husband is going away.’</p>

<p>‘Going away! and where?’</p>

<p>‘To Italy, with his sister, Mrs Carnaby-Hicks.
He has been very worried and
upset lately, Lady Tresham, and he wants
change, and I know it will be best for him—but—but—’</p>

<p>‘You feel the responsibility of being left
alone; that is very natural. Yet, perhaps,
it will teach you self-dependence. And
for my own part, I am glad Sir Roland is
away just now. I want to make friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
with you, my dear; to help you, if it is
in my power. I know your husband has
thought hard things of me, and, perhaps,
of poor Sir Ralph into the bargain; but
in what we did we believed we were acting
for the best. Now, all that is over; you
will neither of you ever want money again,
but you may need advice. And I should
like to begin by advising you. Why do
you not take this trip with your husband?
You look pale and worn out. It would
do you good as well as him.’</p>

<p>‘He does not want me,’ says Juliet,
sadly; ‘he is only going in order to get
away from me.’</p>

<p>‘That is hardly possible. You are a
wife of whom any man must be proud.’</p>

<p>‘I used to be told I was pretty,’ replies
Lady Tresham, with a faint blush; ‘but
that was a long time ago.’</p>

<p>‘Rubbish, child; you are in your prime.
And you have six children; and I have
not even one. What a happy woman you
ought to be.’</p>

<p>But Lady Tresham does not answer.
The tears are rising thickly to her eyes,
and falling down her cheeks again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>‘I would give them all up—yes, every
one!’ she cries, hysterically, ‘to regain
their father’s love. Oh, Lady Tresham,
what must you think of me for speaking
like this to an utter stranger?’</p>

<p>‘Cease to look on me as a stranger,
then, dear child, and let us be friends.
Cannot I do anything to help you out of
this heavy trouble?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing; nothing. It is incurable, and
I must bear it as best I can. He loved
me whilst I had the means to make myself
look pretty; when I had a colour in my
cheeks, and a gloss upon my hair. But I
have lost all that, Lady Tresham. Days
and nights of sickness and privation have
robbed me of my beauty and his love.
And then my temper grew irritable, and
he sickened of his home and me; and I
shall never know any happiness in this
world again.’</p>

<p>‘If you have somewhat wearied your
husband’s love in poverty, you must regain
it in prosperity,’ says Sir Ralph’s widow.</p>

<p>‘Indeed, you do not know him, Lady
Tresham.’</p>

<p>‘I do not know Sir Roland, my dear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
but I have known many men, and they are
all alike. The philosophy of few of them
will survive their personal discomfort. Sir
Roland will find things very different on
his return to England, and the old feelings
will have an opportunity of revival. Come,
my dear girl, you must not lose heart.’</p>

<p>‘But I am so ignorant how to order
things aright,’ sighs Juliet, ‘I have had so
little experience.’</p>

<p>‘I will be your teacher, if you will permit
me. Tresham Court always had the
credit of being well governed under my
reign. And first, I would make an improvement
in your dress. Such a beautiful
figure was never meant to be concealed
under that clumsy thing.’</p>

<p>‘I was obliged to get my mourning
ready made,’ says Juliet, looking down at
her ill-fitting black robe.</p>

<p>‘True; but I must send my dressmaker
to you forthwith. And now let me see the
dear little ones. I love children all the
more that I have never been a mother.’
And so the ladies, already friends, drift
away into that most interesting of feminine
topics, the nursery, and great plans are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
laid for the benefit of Juliet’s little family
before they separate again. On the same
day Sir Roland is making his final preparations
to join his sister’s party, though
not without a few self-reproaches, which
he stifles by recalling the establishment at
Forthill Terrace, Camden Town. It is only
fair, he tells himself, that after so many
years of domestic misery he should use
his unexpected liberty by taking a little
change. And for the first few days the
change bids fair to fulfil its promise. The
Carnaby-Hicks proceed South leisurely,
taking the Rhine on their way, and Sir
Roland can conceive of no more delicious
sensation than floating down the River of
Romance on those balmy August evenings
by the side of Mabel Moore. That young
lady does not spare him in any way. From
the beginning she claims his attendance
for herself, and exercises all her fascination
freely upon the unfortunate man, who
cannot help being attracted by the charms
of her person, and the meaning glances she
so liberally bestows upon him.</p>

<p>‘What a pity that Juliet has not a more
commanding appearance,’ he thinks to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
himself, as he watches Mabel’s fine form
distinctly outlined in the moonlight. ‘Miss
Moore has twice her importance; she
looks as if she had been born to a title.’
And Mabel interrupts his reverie by a
heavy sigh.</p>

<p>‘Why do you sigh, Miss Moore?’</p>

<p>‘I was thinking how unequally this world
is balanced, Sir Roland. Everything goes
wrong, doesn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot quite agree with that sentiment;
not, at least, whilst you and I are
floating down the Rhine together.’</p>

<p>‘But it won’t last.’</p>

<p>‘Not for ever, unfortunately. But let
us enjoy it whilst it does.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot thoroughly enjoy myself when
I know my pleasure must come to an end.
When I am most happy, I remember that in
a few weeks it will all be over, and we shall
be back in Blue Street, and you down at
Tresham Court with your wife and family.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t talk of it please,’ says Sir Roland
with a shudder.</p>

<p>‘<i>Why?</i>’ asks Miss Moore innocently;
‘don’t you love little children?’</p>

<p>‘Not particularly. Do you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>‘I don’t care for most people’s children,
but I should for yours.’</p>

<p>‘You are very good to say so’, replies
Sir Roland: but he knows they are treading
on dangerous ground, and the subject
had better be dropped. As he lies in his
berth that night, and thinks over the
events of the day, he remembers how his
wife told him before their marriage that
she disliked children, and he had twitted
her with the fact on seeing her devotion to
their firstborn. And he recalls how she
had looked into his face with her large
blue eyes—so clear and lovely and loving
as they were in those days—and whispered,
‘But this is <i>yours</i>, Roland.’ There is
something like a tear in Sir Roland Tresham’s
eye as he turns uneasily in his
berth, and thinks how those happy days
have faded; but it is of Juliet, and not of
Mabel, he dreams as he falls asleep. The
Honourable Mrs Carnaby-Hicks sees the
flirtation going on between her niece and
her brother, but does not concern herself
in the matter. Miss Moore knows what
she is about, and is perfectly able to take
care of herself; indeed, Mrs Carnaby-Hicks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
thinks she can already discern
the instinct by which the young lady is
guided. But Sir Roland, who can only
interpret her words and glances by his
own lights, believes himself to be on the
verge of a precipice, and yet has not the
moral courage to fly from a temptation
that is so flattering to his vanity. Mabel’s
chief weapon is melancholy. She professes
melancholy whenever it occurs to
her, until Sir Roland is forced to demand
the reason of her serious looks.</p>

<p>‘How can you ask?’ she says one
evening—the first of their arrival in Venice—‘when
you know that auntie has asked
Lord Ernest Freemantle to join our party
to-morrow?’</p>

<p>‘What difference will that make to us?’</p>

<p>‘Why, will he not expect to be always
by my side, and break in upon the pleasant
<i>têtes-à-tête</i> we have had together?’</p>

<p>‘Have they been so <i>very</i> pleasant to
you then, Mabel?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Sir Roland, cannot you judge of
my feelings by your own?’</p>

<p>‘If I did that—’ he commences fervently,
but there he stops. The vision of two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
blue eyes, dimmed with tears, rises before
him, and he stamps the temptation down.</p>

<p>‘Whatever I may feel,’ he says to himself
afterwards, ‘I will not allow my tongue
to turn traitor,’ and so Miss Moore is
disappointed of her answer.</p>

<p>Letters came to him frequently from his
wife—long letters, in which she gives him
a full account of her friendship with Sir
Ralph’s widow, but not a word of the way
in which she is managing the household.</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t think the presence of the
dowager will do much to enliven the
Court,’ remarks Mrs Carnaby-Hicks
spitefully.</p>

<p>‘She is not likely to teach my wife
extravagance,’ laughs Sir Roland; ‘but
Juliet and she seem to get on very well
together.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps she is a style that suits Lady
Tresham,’ says his sister. ‘I have always
understood she was a dowdy and a screw.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t mean to let my wife <i>screw</i>,’
replies the baronet uneasily. ‘She has
had little enough pin-money hitherto, poor
girl, and she shall have a liberal allowance
now, if nothing else.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>‘Why do you call Lady Tresham “poor”?’
whispers Mabel in his ear. ‘I should have
said she was the richest of women.’</p>

<p>‘Not quite that,’ he answers, wilfully
misunderstanding her, ‘though she need
have no fear for the future. But she has
had barely enough for comfort until now.’</p>

<p>‘She has always had <i>you</i>,’ says Miss
Moore, softly.</p>

<p>‘Some ladies might consider that an
extra misfortune!’</p>

<p>‘<i>Some</i> might,’ echoes the girl with a
heavy sigh, the meaning of which it is
impossible to misconstrue. Lord Ernest
Freemantle proves to be a simple, undersized
little gentleman, who is very much
enamoured of Miss Mabel Moore, and
becomes proportionately jealous of Sir
Roland Tresham. And the latter, delighted
at the feeling he has provoked,
takes pleasure in exciting it to the last
degree, by a still closer attendance on the
young lady. One evening, when she has
refused to accompany Lord Ernest and
her aunt on a walking expedition through
the town, Sir Roland persuades her to
go on the water with him in a gondola.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Mabel assents with alacrity, and they are
soon floating together over the placid
surface of the canal, seated under the
canopy at one end of the boat, whilst the
gondoliers ply their oars to the music of
their own voices at the other.</p>

<p>‘How I wish we could go floating on like
this into eternity,’ remarks Sir Roland,
presently.</p>

<p>‘It would be very easy,’ replies Mabel
in a low voice. ‘It is but to cast ourselves
over the side into those dark waters and
sink out of sight for ever. It would be
a happier fate—at least for me—than any
I have to look forward to.’</p>

<p>‘You mustn’t talk like that. You are
young, and have every prospect of a happy
life before you.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, I have not.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Mabel, why those tears?’
exclaims Sir Roland, as the girl dashes
her hand across her eyes. ‘What have I
said to vex you?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing. But life is so hard, and—and—disappointing.’</p>

<p>He passes his arm around her waist.</p>

<p>‘Tell me what makes it so to you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, Roland,’ she whispers, ‘<i>you know</i>.’</p>

<p>The tone, the words, are too much for
him. To hold a pretty woman in his arms
and hear her murmuring her love for himself
would be perhaps too much for any
man. Anyway, it disperses all Sir Roland’s
prudence.</p>

<p>‘My <i>darling</i>,’ he says emphatically, ‘why
cannot we end all this misery, and live for
each other from this time forward?’ But
as he speaks, the gondoliers alter their
chant, and strike up a little Neapolitan
barcarolle. It is a simple plaintive air,
without much merit in itself, but the last
time Sir Roland heard it, it came from
Juliet’s lips as she was hushing a fractious
child to rest. In a moment the past scene
rises before him. He can see his wife’s
drooping figure, the sad look in her eyes;
can hear the faltering tones of her weary
voice. He recalls, in fact, the mother of
his children, the woman who has borne,
however impatiently, the burden and heat
of the day with him; and all the best part
of the man’s nature rises up to condemn
his present faithless action.</p>

<p>‘God in heaven!’ he exclaims aloud;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
‘what am I saying and doing? Mabel,
forgive me! It was the madness of a
moment. It shall never be repeated.’</p>

<p>But he has said the words, and they are
not to be unsaid. Miss Moore enjoys the
situation. It appeals to her romantic proclivities,
and she clings to him tightly even
whilst she murmurs.</p>

<p>‘Oh no; you mustn’t say such things to
me. It is very, very wrong. But, Roland,
to know you love me atones for everything.
I can die happy now.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, I had no right to speak to you
in such a manner, but your tears made me
lose sight of prudence. Mabel, promise
me that you will forget what I said.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t ask me that, it will be so sweet
to remember,’ she says, still clinging to him.
He tries gently to disengage himself.</p>

<p>‘Sit back on your seat, there’s a good
girl. These fellows are looking at us.
Mabel, try and be calm. We must never
mention this subject again. It is too
painful.’</p>

<p>‘But why should we deny ourselves the
poor delights of memory, since it is all that
is left?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>‘We must stamp it out. It can lead to
no good for either of us; and for you,
perhaps, to irreparable harm. I am not a
Trojan in virtue, Mabel; you must not try
me too hard.’</p>

<p>‘But you will love me always, Roland,
will you not?’</p>

<p>What can he say? He knows already
that he does not love her at all. But he is
a man, and she is a woman, and he does as
many other men would do—he swears he
shall never cease to care for her.</p>

<p>‘If I were free!’ he murmurs; ‘but you
see how it is, my darling. I am bound
hand and foot, and we never can be anything
more than we are to one another. I
must not quite forget my poor children.’</p>

<p>‘But we shall be friends always, shall
we not?’</p>

<p>‘The very best and closest of friends,
but we mustn’t trust ourselves alone again.
You are too lovely, Mabel, and I—I am
too weak. I am sure you must see the
reason of what I say?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; yes. But let us enjoy this one
last evening together. Don’t go home just
yet. Remember it is for the last time.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>He cannot but yield to her entreaty, but
when they reach the hotel he resolves that
it must never occur again. Mabel Moore
is not the woman to let him off easily.
She will make him remember his avowal
of that evening for ever afterwards, and
Sir Roland feels that his only safety lies in
flight. During the self-reproachful night
that follows, when the thought of his wife
and children rises up to make him acknowledge
that nothing in the whole world could
compensate him for the loss of that which
he has held so loosely, he makes a resolution
to return to Tresham Court the very
next morning. Poor Juliet! Now he
comes to think of it, he does not believe he
has given her one kiss of congratulation on
her newly-acquired dignity. They were
beginning to be very unhappy in the past,
he knows, but it seems hard now that he
should have visited the entire blame on the
head of the woman who had so much the
heavier portion of the load to bear. When
he rises the following morning his first act
is to seek the apartments of his sister, and
inform her of his determination to return to
England. He finds Mrs Carnaby-Hicks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
radiantly triumphant, and apparently quite
indifferent as to whether he remains with
them or not.</p>

<p>‘My dear Roland, you must do just as
you think best, and indeed I have this
moment received news that renders it very
improbable that we shall be able to extend
our trip to Italy this year. Lord Ernest
Freemantle has proposed to our dear
Mabel. Mr Carnaby-Hicks is delighted,
and so am I. I have had hopes of such
an occurrence for a long time (for no one
could help seeing how Lord Ernest admired
our dear girl), but your taking her
out in the gondola alone last evening
brought matters to a crisis. And indeed,
were it not for the issue, I should feel almost
disposed to quarrel with you, Roland,
for being so careless of her reputation. It
might have turned matters just the other
way. You are too young and handsome to
play such freaks with an unmarried girl.’</p>

<p>‘From what you say, then, I may conclude
Miss Moore has accepted Lord
Ernest’s offer.’</p>

<p>‘Why, of course! What else should she
do? And as he is anxious the marriage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
should take place as soon as possible, I
suppose we shall have to go home again.’</p>

<p>‘Then, will you convey my warmest congratulations
to the bride-elect, and tell her
that I trust we shall meet again in England?’</p>

<p>‘Won’t you stop and see her yourself?’</p>

<p>‘I think not—thanks! I see there is a
midday train to Paris, which I can catch
if I lose no time. So I will wish you
good-bye at once, Valeria!’</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, my dear Roland! We shall,
as you say, soon meet again, and I think
you are wise to return, for I am afraid all
our fun is over for this season!’</p>

<p>The midday train takes him to Paris,
and the next day he finds himself on his
road to Glamorganshire. The carriage in
which he travels is filled with men, all
strangers to him, but who converse freely
with one another.</p>

<p>‘Have you seen the new owner of Tresham
Court, Conway?’ asks one fellow of
his neighbour.</p>

<p>‘What, Sir Roland? Not yet! He is
abroad, so I am told, and won’t be home
till Christmas!’</p>

<p>‘By George! Well, if I were the owner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
of Lady Tresham the country wouldn’t see
me that didn’t hold her!’</p>

<p>‘Is she so handsome then?’</p>

<p>‘She’s better than handsome! She’s
one of the sweetest-looking women I ever
saw. I met her at General Carroll’s last
week with the dowager.’</p>

<p>‘Fair or dark?’</p>

<p>‘Fair as a lily, with glorious golden hair,
and great blue eyes as clear as spring
water. She’s as graceful as a gazelle, too,
and got a voice like a thrush. She said
she was awfully out of practice, but she
sung better than anyone there.’</p>

<p>‘I shall get my mother to take me over
to Tresham Court,’ says a young dandy in
the corner; ‘a pretty woman is not to be
despised in Glamorganshire.’</p>

<p>‘You won’t get anything by that, my
boy,’ says the first speaker. ‘Handley
Harcourt, the dowager’s nephew, has
found her out already, and is there morning,
noon, and night.’</p>

<p>Sir Roland is just about to proclaim that
the beautiful woman they speak of is his
wife, when the last sentence makes him
shrink back in his seat instead. He feels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
ashamed to acknowledge her now. What
if the scandal should be true! But no, it
is impossible! Juliet has been his wife
for eight long years, and faithful to him in
thought, word, and deed. He would answer
for her fidelity as for his own. <i>His own!</i>
At that thought the hot blood courses
through Sir Roland’s veins, and mantles
in his handsome face. He has <i>not</i> been
faithful to her—he acknowledges it with
shame—but he will atone as there is a
heaven above him.</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen,’ he says suddenly, ‘the lady
you speak of is my wife, and had you all
been at Tresham Court during my absence,
‘morning, noon, and night,’ it would not
have given me a moment’s uneasiness.’
His confession is naturally followed by
apologies, introductions, hand-shaking, and
general invitations to the Court. Sir Roland
even assures the somewhat shy little
dandy in the corner that he has his hearty
permission to flirt with Lady Tresham as
much as possible. And then they all light
up and try each other’s cigars, and become
the fastest of friends in a very few minutes.
Yet as he leaves them at the station, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
the carriage is in waiting to convey him
home, he cannot help wondering at the
enthusiasm his wife’s looks have provoked
amongst them. She <i>used</i> to be very pretty
in their first wedded days, before she grew
so careless of her personal appearance—when
she took pride in arraying her graceful
little form, and dressing her beautiful
hair, but slatternly clothes and unbecoming
<i>coiffure</i> are sufficient to conceal the
beauty of any woman. Well! Sir Roland
supposes that such things can be altered,
but if he finds that Juliet’s bad taste is irreparable,
he will be content with her as she
is. He has brought enough trouble on her
head already—the present shall never be
clouded by his reproaches nor complaints.
He is so eager to make atonement for the
past, that the five miles between the station
and Tresham Court appear like ten; but they
are accomplished at last, and the carriage
rolls through the iron gates and up the
wooded drive. Half-way they come upon
a group of children escorted by their nurses
and a groom. Two beautiful boys in velvet
suits, with golden curls falling over
their Vandyke collars, are mounted on one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
pony, whilst another animal carries a pair
of panniers, from which familiar little faces
and blue eyes gaze up expectantly to meet
his own.</p>

<p>‘Can those be my children?’ exclaims
Sir Roland to himself; and then he gives
the order to stop, and another minute sees
him in the midst of them. But what a
change! He can scarcely believe they
are the same brats who, six weeks ago,
used to hang over the garden palings in
Camden Town, and put out their tongues
at the passers-by—Lily and May in their
white frocks and black ribbons, and little
Roland in his smart pelisse; and the boys
looking such noble fellows in their jackets
and knickerbockers, with sunny hair, and
clean faces and hands—it seems like a
dream to the father as he kisses them all
round, and admires the ponies and the
panniers to their hearts’ content. He
strides on to the house with his bosom
swelling with pride at the appearance of
his little ones, and is almost too pre-occupied
to notice that everything is perfectly
arranged within the Court and out.</p>

<p>A footman meets him at the door with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
the information that her ladyship awaits
him in the morning-room, and thither, still
in a dream, Sir Roland rapidly proceeds.
As he enters the apartment he starts back,
thunderstruck with amazement. A lady
stands upon the hearthrug—a woman delicately
fair, and very lovely, though still
too thin and pale, and with tears of expectation
and suspense within her eyes.</p>

<p>She is robed in black velvet, fitting
closely to her graceful figure—at her throat
and wrists are falls of Venetian lace—and
her dainty feet are cased in silk stockings
and buckled shoes. Her golden hair cut
short upon her brow, is piled in innumerable
little curls upon the top of her head,
which grow longer and longer until they
lay in a flossy mass upon her neck and
shoulders. For a moment, Sir Roland
gazes at this unlooked-for apparition in
utter silence.</p>

<p>‘Husband!’ says Juliet shyly, ‘don’t
you know me?’</p>

<p>‘My dearest!’ he exclaims, rushing forward
and clasping her in his arms; ‘how
beautiful you have become.’</p>

<p>Then, with the touch of his arms and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
lips, all her womanhood asserts itself, and
she casts herself, sobbing, on his breast.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Roland! forgive me! forgive me!
Take me back and love me as you used
to do!’</p>

<p>‘What have I to forgive you, darling?’</p>

<p>‘All my ill-temper and impatience and
want of fortitude. I bore our lot so
badly—I did not deserve to have it
bettered—and now that prosperity has
come to us, I feel it will be worthless
without your love.’</p>

<p>‘But you have my love, Juliet! you
have never lost it. The ills and discomforts
of poverty soured my nature, and
made me behave like a brute to you; but
my heart has been yours through it all,
dearest wife, and I have never been more
convinced of the fact than during our
present separation.’</p>

<p>She looks up at him and smiles—oh!
such a heavenly smile of renewed happiness
and hope.</p>

<p>‘And, Roland, you are quite, <i>quite</i> sure
that you love me best of all the world!
That there is no other woman dearer
to you than myself?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>He has just <i>one</i> twinge as she puts the
question to him; but men are used to
twinges, and he can answer honestly,—</p>

<p>‘Not <i>one</i>, my love!—not a single one!
nor ever shall be. Take your husband’s
word for it, and let us resolve from this
moment to banish the painful memory of
the Past, and live for each other only in
the Future.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And so they have and do, and there is
only one thing that Lady Tresham cannot
understand, which is Sir Roland’s rooted
aversion to Lady Ernest Freemantle. He
will not let his wife invite her down to
Tresham Court, although she has often
hinted she would like to visit them, and
all the excuse he can give for his conduct
is that he does not choose to cultivate the
lady’s acquaintance.</p>

<p>So the matter rests, and as long as Sir
Roland does not renew it, there is no
need he should confess the little scene
that took place in the gondola on the
moonlighted Venice canal.</p>

<p class="center">THE END.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><i>June 4th, 18—</i>.—Thermometer
at 100 in the shade, and up to
heaven knows where in the sun;
somewhere about boiling heat, I
should imagine, if I may judge by the state
of my shirt sleeves. A cheerful climate in
which to ask a man to spend the best days
of his life, for the visionary prospect of surviving
twenty years’ service and retiring
on half-pay. If it were not for Janie, I
could not stand it. Here we are, cooped
up in an old Dutch fort, with three miles
of desert plain between us and the sea;
the very house we live in built on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
remains of a cemetery; the ruined graves
of which stare us in the face every time
we look out of the drawing-room windows.
The consequence of which is, that Janie
would not stay in the house by herself after
dark for any earthly consideration; and if
she cannot procure a female friend to dance
attendance on her fears, I am cut out of
my bachelor entertainments. Not that I
wish to complain; far from it; it would be
hard if I could not give up some pleasures
in exchange for such a wife as mine—but
I have found it awkward at times. Then
we have no society but such as the regiment
affords; and as a married man I am, of
course, not so much at the mess as heretofore.
Altogether Mushin-Bunda is not
lively; and my wife is the only creature
who makes it bearable to me.</p>

<p>I don’t wonder that the whole cantonment
voted me a lucky fellow when I
obtained the promise of her hand. The
first time I ever saw her at the house of
her married sister—the wife of Delville, of
our 44th, since ordered to Burmah—I
thought her the prettiest, most lovable little
woman I had ever seen; and during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
twelve months of our happy married life, I
have had no reason to alter my opinion.
Janie is all that a man could possibly desire
in a wife; and so I tell myself twenty times
a day. Never have I seen her face clouded
with passion or ill-humour: whatever I
propose to do is invariably the thing she
has just been wishing for; she never dissents
from me either in opinion or desire;
she never even meets me without the same
quiet smile, which has deservedly gained
her the credit of being such ‘a very sweet
young woman.’ She is a cushat-dove,
made to nestle into a man’s affections and
to remain there; for who with a heart
could bear to wound the feelings of one so
sensitive and pure? I don’t believe at
this moment, that in all the length and
breadth of India there exists a happier or
more contented fellow than myself; and if
we only had a little more society, a little
company occasionally to turn our thoughts
from dwelling incessantly upon ourselves,
our life would leave nothing to be desired.
Not but what my Janie is the world to me;
still, a woman is but a woman after all, and
the days are apt to become monotonous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>Oh, this horrid Mushin-Bunda! could
anything reconcile me to a life-long expatriation
in a place like this? The very
thought is desolation.</p>

<p><i>June 6th.</i>—Two days ago I was complaining
of the lack of company to be found
in Mushin-Bunda. This evening I feel
inclined to write myself down an ass, and
say that my foolishness has returned upon
my own pate, for we are likely to have
more company than we care for. I was
in the verandah this morning smoking and
grumbling, and as I turned from the contemplation
of the glaring compound to
where Janie sat in her white dress, bending
over some letters she had just received, I
decided she was the only cool thing within
my range of sight. The dogs were lying
panting on the gravel with their tongues
out. The constant motion of the flapping
punkah did not appear to do more than stir
the heat. Even the quiet easy-going tailor
sitting cross-legged at my feet, could not
proceed with his work unless he dipped
his black fingers every minute in a bowl of
water. Everything looked hot, horrible,
and sticky, except Janie herself. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
there sat my cushat-dove—half buried in
the flounces of her muslin dress—a fair,
plump, placid little woman; the effect of
heat on whom is only to make her look
more white and cool, with her sunny hair
drawn off her tranquil features, and her
calm blue eyes riveted on the open letter
which she held in her hand. None of
your passionate, raving, storming creatures
this, who nearly squeeze you to death one
moment, and stick a knife into you the
next; but a proper sort of woman for
a wife and mother, or so I choose to
call her; and I really couldn’t take my
eyes off her moonlight beauty, until I was
roused from my reverie by hearing her
plaintive voice exclaiming,—</p>

<p>‘Oh dear! oh dear! how very unfortunate!
Whatever will the poor girl
do?’</p>

<p>‘Of whom are you talking, my darling?’
I asked, as I cast away the remains of my
cigar, and advanced towards her.</p>

<p>‘Of my cousin Lionne, Robert dear;
Margaret Anstruther, of whom I have so
often spoken to you. I told you some
time ago, didn’t I, that in consequence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
her mother’s death she was coming out to
the care of our uncle, Colonel Anstruther,
at Madras?’</p>

<p>‘Well, what of it? Has she arrived?’</p>

<p>‘No; but this letter is from Uncle Henry,
and he is in such a dilemma. He expected
Margaret to be with him four or
five mails ago; but her guardians have
delayed and delayed to send her out; and
now, just as he is ordered off to China
to join his regiment, he receives a letter
to say that she will arrive by the next
steamer.’</p>

<p>‘And he will have left Madras?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; and for six months at least. He
does not know what on earth to do about
it.’</p>

<p>And Janie, in an uncertain manner,
kept turning the sheet of paper over and
over in her hands.</p>

<p>‘He must ask one of his lady friends
to receive Miss Anstruther,’ I suggested.</p>

<p>‘So he would, Robert, were it not for
so long a time. But a six months’ visit is
too much to expect from any stranger. If
Emma were only here, Uncle Henry would
have sent Margaret to her.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>‘It is certainly very inconvenient,’ I
remarked carelessly.</p>

<p>‘I suppose, Robert dear,’ said Janie, in
a dubious and hesitating manner,—‘I suppose
<i>we</i> could not offer to take in Margaret
till Uncle Henry returns from China?’</p>

<p>I started. The idea had not presented
itself to me before, and it was certainly
not a pleasant one. I hope I am not of
an inhospitable turn of mind; but the
prospect of having a perfect stranger located
beneath our roof for such a length
of time was anything but agreeable to me.
I remembered Janie’s want of companionship,
and the many times I had had to
resign the society of my brother-officers on
her account, and felt resigned; but the
next moment I thought of all my quiet
evenings with my loving little wife being
broken in upon; of our cosy walks, and
talks, and drives being done away with,
and for six long months—and I daresay I
did look blank. Indeed, I must have done
so; for Janie, who is not, generally speaking,
what is termed quick of observation,
saw the change in my countenance and
commented upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>‘You don’t like the notion, Robert dear?’
she said, in a tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>‘Well, Janie, I can’t say I do; but if it
must be, it must be. What does your
uncle say on the subject?’</p>

<p>‘He says it would be a great convenience,
of course, and that he does not know
to whom else to apply, or he would not
trouble us. And Margaret and I were at
school together, Robert: we were brought
up quite like sisters; so it would seem
strange if she were to go to anyone else.
And it is only for six months; and Uncle
Henry says that he does not expect us to
be put to any expense about it, for that
he—’</p>

<p>‘Oh, blow the expense!’ I irreverently
interrupted. ‘When does Colonel Anstruther
leave Madras, Janie?’</p>

<p>‘Next week; and Margaret is to arrive
the week after.’</p>

<p>‘And what arrangements can he make
for her joining us at Mushin-Bunda?’</p>

<p>‘Mrs Grant, a friend of his, has offered
to receive Margaret on her arrival, and to
keep her until a steamer starts for here,
which will probably not be long first.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>‘Very well. Write to your uncle, and
say that we shall be proud to give Miss
Anstruther house-room until such time as
he may be able to reclaim her.’</p>

<p>‘And you’re not vexed about it, Robert
dear?’ said Janie timidly.</p>

<p>I stooped and kissed her.</p>

<p>‘Not a bit, darling,’ I answered gaily.
‘Half-a-dozen cousins could make no
difference to our love; and as long as that
remains unaltered, I care for nothing else.’
Upon which my little wife brightened up
again, and prepared to write an answer
to her uncle’s letter; and I lit another
cigar, and resumed my old position in the
verandah.</p>

<p>I told Janie that the stranger’s coming
could make no difference to me; but I feel
that I have not spoken the truth in saying
so, and I blame myself for thinking as
strongly as I do upon the subject. Surely
I am swayed by prejudice.</p>

<p>After all, supposing that Miss Anstruther
does remain with us during the whole of
her uncle’s sojourn in China, where will be
the great misfortune of entertaining a young
lady for a few months? and how could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
we have done otherwise than offer to receive
a friendless girl, arriving in the country
under such peculiar circumstances? who
has also, by marriage, become a connection
of my own, and been reared in such intimate
relations with my wife, as to be
looked on by Janie almost in the light of a
sister. It would have been quite impossible
to act otherwise; therefore I feel
I had better make a virtue of a necessity.
At the same time, try as I will, I cannot
bring myself to look on the anticipated
visit as a pleasure, although I am sure that
much of my prejudice arises from my wife’s
innocent praises of her cousin, which prove
Miss Anstruther to be so opposite, in
appearance and disposition, to herself, that
I feel I shall never like the girl. Well, I
was wishing for more society in Mushin-Bunda;
and now I shall have it. Some
one to dance attendance on, and to mind
my p’s and q’s before, for the next six
months; and if I haven’t had enough of
society before the end of that time, it’s a
pity. Warren says it’s all nonsense; that
he had a friend of his wife’s once staying
in the house for several weeks, and that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
was great fun; and that before Miss Anstruther
has been with us half that time, I
shall look on her as a sister, and forget all
about my p’s and q’s.</p>

<p>I laugh at the idea, and pretend to agree
with him; but it is of no use; a presentiment
of annoyance for me seems to cling
to the name of Margaret Anstruther, until
I wish I had never even heard its sound.
However, as I said to my wife, what must
be, must be, and the best method of evading
a worry is not to think about it.
Easier said than done!</p>

<p><i>June 16th.</i>—If anything were necessary
to make me take a still farther dislike to
the idea of our expected guest, it would
be provided in the fact that Janie and I
have nearly come to words about her, for
the first time in our married life.</p>

<p>‘Come, darling,’ I said to her this evening,
when at last the fierce sun had sunk
below the horizon, and it was possible to
quit the house; ‘put on your hat, and let
us have a little stroll in the compound
together, we may not have many more
opportunities of walking alone.’</p>

<p>Our ‘compound,’ as the ground surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
an Indian bungalow is usually
called, is a large piece of uncultivated
land, sheltered by lanky cocoa-nut trees,
and carpeted with burnt-up turf from end
to end, whereof is cut a sandy track, which
we term our carriage-drive.</p>

<p>Janie was ready in a moment, and up and
down the track of sand we wandered, arm-in-arm,
inhaling eagerly the faint breath
of sea-air wafted to us from across the
plain which separates us from the ocean.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Robert dear!’ said Janie, casting
up her pensive blue eyes to meet my own,
‘I wish I had never written that letter to
Uncle Henry. I am more sure every day
that you don’t like the notion of Lionne
staying with us.’</p>

<p>I can’t think what put the letter or her
cousin into my wife’s head at that particular
moment; for I have not alluded to the
subject for several days past.</p>

<p>‘My dearest child,’ I answered her,
‘whether I like it or not is of little consequence.
There is no alternative; therefore
we must bear the infliction as best we
may. Thank heaven, it will not be for ever.’</p>

<p>‘But you are not to look upon it as an infliction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Robert,’ said Janie, as she squeezed
my arm, ‘because, directly you see Margaret,
you will like her.’</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders incredulously.</p>

<p>‘But indeed you will,’ continued my
little wife with, for her, a most unusual
display of energy. ‘You don’t know how
nice-looking she is; tall and slight, with
large dark eyes and—’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, I know,’ I interrupted impatiently.
‘Six feet high, and gaunt as a
cab-horse, with flaming black eyes and
hair, and a complexion like Spanish olives.
I know the sort of woman, Janie; you’ve
described her to me often enough. The
less said about her beauty the better.’</p>

<p>‘But she’s not a bit like that,’ said dear
little Janie, almost ready to cry at my
description of her cousin. ‘Lionne is very
graceful and exceedingly handsome; every
one says so. Indeed, Robert dear, you
are quite mistaken.’</p>

<p>‘She won’t be handsome to me,’ I answered,
appeasing her with a kiss, ‘since
she must be so different from yourself,
Janie. Nothing will go down with me,
darling, except it be golden hair and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
marble skin; and then they must be the
hair and the skin of but one woman in the
world.’ And I looked into the face of my
cushat-dove until I made her blush and
laugh nervously with her tremulous happiness.
Dear little Janie! God keep me
ever true to her!—‘Why do you call your
cousin “Lionne,” instead of by her proper
name?’ I asked, as soon as the billing and
cooing episode had somewhat subsided,
and we had leisure to revert to the subject
under discussion. ‘Margaret is pretty
enough, and the other has no connection
with it, let alone its signification rendering
it very unsuitable for a lady.’</p>

<p>At this question my wife reddened; but,
after a little pressing, confessed it was a
nickname which had been bestowed on
Miss Anstruther at school.</p>

<p>‘She is a dear, generous creature, Robert
dear,’ she pleaded; ‘but just a little hasty,
or at least she used to be; but of course
she will have got over all that by this
time’ (not so sure, thought I); ‘and we
girls used to call her ‘La Lionne’ just for
fun, you know, and somehow the name
stuck to her. Oh, you should have seen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
her in a rage!’ continued Janie, warming
beneath the recollection; ‘her eyes used
to flash such glorious fire, and she didn’t
seem to care what she did. Once, when I
offended her, she flew at me just like a
little cat, and bit me on the arm.’ And
Janie laughed softly at the remembrance
which made my blood boil.</p>

<p>‘What a she-devil!’ I exclaimed indignantly,
as I thought of the fair flesh, of
which I was so tender, lacerated by the
teeth of a gaunt school-girl with vicious
black eyes. ‘I should like to have caught
her at it!’</p>

<p>Then Janie seemed to think she had
said too much, and tried to retract.</p>

<p>‘Oh, but, Robert dear!’ she exclaimed,
‘she is very different now, you know;
that all happened long ago; and though
we still call her Lionne, it is seldom that
she ever gives way to her temper. I have
not seen her for some years; but when
we last met we had not a word together
during the whole period of her stay.’</p>

<p>‘And how long may that have been, Janie?’</p>

<p>‘For three weeks; and she was so pleasant
and kind, you can’t think.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>Three weeks! I groaned in my spirit;
and we are to endure six months of the
company of this lady who is called Lionne,
in compliment to the amiability of her
disposition, and bites and scratches like a
cat whenever she is offended. I began to
think of clothing myself and my wife in
mail armour during the period of her stay,
so that we might be invulnerable to her
attacks; but a remark to that effect to
Janie seemed greatly to discompose her.</p>

<p>‘It is not fair of you, Robert dear,’ she
said, with knitted brows, ‘to take my confidence
in such a spirit. It is all nonsense
to suppose that Margaret will be like that
now; she is a charming girl, who is universally
admired.’</p>

<p>‘I am delighted to hear it,’ I replied
sarcastically. ‘I hope, however, that she
won’t take a liking to me; or that, if she
does, she will keep her charming teeth to
herself.’</p>

<p>‘I daresay you won’t be troubled with
her long,’ exclaimed Janie, with a degree
of excitement which I foresaw would end
in tears. ‘Margaret attracts lovers wherever
she goes, and we shall have her engaged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
and married most likely before she
has been many weeks in Mushin-Bunda.’</p>

<p>‘Worse and worse,’ I inadvertently replied.
‘If I thought that was to be the
end of it, Janie, I should cut and run at
once.’</p>

<p>Visions of my brother officers lounging
about the drawing-room all day, and snarling
at each other like rival curs—of a
wedding, and all the paraphernalia and
fuss attendant on it—made me give vent to
the horror which I felt in the anticipation.</p>

<p>‘Ah! you didn’t think it all so horrid a
year ago!’ said my wife, melting into the
promised tears; ‘but I suppose you have
forgotten that by this time, or wish, perhaps,
that it had never been.’</p>

<p>The conclusion struck me as unreasonable;
but when women arrive at that stage
they are not in a fit state to be argued
with, and are best left alone.</p>

<p>‘It’s very different when one plays first
fiddle in the case, dear child,’ I answered
soothingly; but Janie was no longer in a
humour to be soothed.</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe you think so, Robert,’ she
said; ‘and as for poor Lionne, I’m sure—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, for heaven’s sake! let’s talk of
something else than poor Lionne!’ I answered
hastily. ‘I’m sure we’ve had
enough of her for one evening; and, for
my part, I’m getting quite sick of her
name.’</p>

<p>It was a foolish, unthinking speech to
make; and Janie took it so thoroughly to
heart, that she walked away from my side
into the house, and had cried herself sick
and ill before I had the manliness to find
her out and ask her pardon for my rudeness,
and promise to try and like her
cousin for her sake. I must be more careful
of Janie. She is not strong enough to
endure much emotion; and she loves me
so tenderly, that the least suspicion of
unkindness on my part upsets her.</p>

<p>Well, this is the first shadow of a disagreement
that we have ever had; may it
be the last! That it has occurred on the
subject of Margaret Anstruther, is not
likely to increase my predilection in favour
of that young lady.</p>

<p><i>June 17th.</i>—I did not go to bed till late
last evening, for I was vexed at what had
taken place between myself and Janie, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
could not readily compose myself to sleep.
However, I did so at last, vowing to endure
all the cousins in creation fastened upon me
for all time, sooner than bring another needless
tear into the tender eyes of my cushat-dove;
and was wakened at gun-fire this
morning by the intelligence that the <i>Ostrich</i>
(the steamer by which we expected Miss
Anstruther to arrive) was telegraphed from
Coeranapoot, and would be off Mushin-Bunda
in the course of a few hours.</p>

<p>Owing to the agreeable peculiarities of
the place we live in, I was obliged at once
to rise from my bed, and prepare to ride
down to the fort, the currents here being of
such a nature that vessels cannot come
within a couple of miles of land; and if
boats are not ready on their arrival to convey
the passengers on shore, they carry
them on without ceremony to the next port.
I wakened Janie with a dozen kisses,
begged and prayed of her to think no more
of what happened last night, assured her
that I intend to be all that is amiable, and
learn to like her cousin as much as she
does, and having thrown myself into my
clothes, departed full of good resolutions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
leaving her childish face radiant with smiles,
and beaming in expectation of the coming
meeting.</p>

<p>As I turned my horse out of the compound,
I met a brother officer, Forster by
name, also mounted, and riding apparently
in the same direction.</p>

<p>‘Where are you off to so early?’ I
inquired.</p>

<p>‘I am going on board the <i>Ostrich</i>,’ he
replied, ‘to try and get a sight of my friend
Dunn, who is to cross to Burmah in her.
Will you come with me?’</p>

<p>‘It is where I am bound for. I am on
my way to meet Miss Anstruther, my wife’s
cousin.’</p>

<p>‘Lucky dog!’ said Forster. He is one
of those fellows who imagine that no age,
position, or circumstances are powerful
enough to prevent a man admiring a pretty
woman. ‘If all I have heard about her
from Dunn is true, you are not likely to
have your house much to yourself whilst
Miss Anstruther is in it, Norton.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I shall go out of it, then,’ I answered,
not over pleased at the notion of
never being left in peace with Janie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>‘Dunn says she’s beautiful. I didn’t
know you expected her in the <i>Ostrich</i>.
He’ll never believe now that I went on
board with the intention of seeing himself.’</p>

<p>‘He must have but a small opinion of
your friendship for him.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes, perhaps; but this is not an
ordinary occasion. From all I hear, Norton,
Miss Anstruther must be—you’ll
excuse my saying so—a regular out-and-outer.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed! You know more about her
than I do. She has not been above a
week or ten days in Madras.’</p>

<p>‘I know; but Dunn was introduced to
her in England, and quite excited to find
she had come out to this country. Will
she remain long with you?’</p>

<p>‘Till Colonel Anstruther returns from
China,’ I replied, with an inward sigh.</p>

<p>‘Lucky fellow!’ repeated Forster, with a
grin. ‘Don’t you wish he may lay his
venerable bones there?’</p>

<p>I did not feel equal to pursuing this
conversation in the strain which Forster
evidently expected of me, and so I tried to
turn it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>‘The tide is very high to-day,’ I remarked,
as we rode into the fort, and came
in sight of the sea.</p>

<p>‘By Jove! so it is; and yesterday it
barely washed the landing-quay. What
a sell it would be, Norton, if some day
this sea, with its changeable tides, was to
take it into its head to overflow the fort
and flood the cantonment!’</p>

<p>‘How <i>could</i> it?’ I exclaimed, hastily.</p>

<p>The idea is ridiculous, and as ridiculous
my feeling annoyed at it, for I have never
heard it mooted by any one before; and
yet it is not a pleasant one; for the plain
is so very level, and we have no protection
whatever from the encroachments of the
ocean.</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t know,’ he answered; ‘but
I think I’ve read of such things. It would
be a regular washing for these poor devils
in the fort, though, wouldn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t talk of anything so horrible!’ I
answered.</p>

<p>And then we hailed a boat; and dismounting
from our horses, gave them into
the charge of their native grooms, and
were soon dancing over the sunny waves.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
It was dancing with a vengeance; for the
cross-currents are so various, that at one
moment we were driven a long way out
of our course, and the next shot back again
in the opposite direction with a rapidity
which threatened to upset the frail structure
to which we had trusted ourselves.
Meanwhile the <i>Ostrich</i> steamed slowly
into sight, and took up her station at the
usual distance from land; whilst we beat
about the harbour for more than an hour,
wondering if we should ever board her; and
half afraid, more than once, that she would
depart again without our having accomplished it.
But we were successful at last;
and the first object which I saw on reaching
the deck was the figure of a girl, sitting
apart by herself in a distant and reserved
manner, which I immediately singled out
as that of Miss Anstruther, and the sequel
proved that I was right.</p>

<p>‘Is Miss Anstruther on board?’ was
the query which Forster put to his friend
Dunn, as they met at the head of the
gangway.</p>

<p>‘Yes, she is,’ was the reply; ‘but I can’t
say I’ve seen much of her. She seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
very different from what she was in England
last year. But I think she hates this
country, and—’</p>

<p>‘Dunn, this is my friend Captain Norton;
allow me to introduce you. Mrs Norton
is Miss Anstruther’s cousin, Dunn; he
has come on board expressly to meet her.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, of course; very happy, I’m
sure,’ said Mr Dunn; and in consequence
no farther allusion was made to Miss
Anstruther’s likes or dislikes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I found the captain, and got
him to introduce me to the young lady.
It was a proud cold face which she turned
towards me as my name was mentioned
to her, and the hand she offered lay very
passive in my grasp; but she said all that
was pleasant and polite, and intimated that
her luggage was ready to be put into the
boat, and she to follow me at any time, so
that there was no reason for delay; and
after I had assured her how eagerly Janie
was on the look-out for her arrival, and
she had bidden adieu to the captain, we
prepared to return to shore. We were
obliged to have two boats on account of
the luggage; and what was my surprise to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
see Forster slip down after us into the
second, as though he were one of the
party.</p>

<p>‘You have deserted the company of
your friend Dunn very quickly,’ I remarked
to him. ‘The <i>Ostrich</i> does not leave
for another hour. I thought you were
going to breakfast on board.’</p>

<p>‘I thought of doing so,’ he answered
carelessly (he had been talking of nothing
else on our way there); ‘but perhaps it’s
better not—might miss the boat, you see,
which would be awkward. Will you introduce
me to Miss Anstruther?’</p>

<p>I went through the required formula;
but after the customary acknowledgment of
it, Miss Anstruther took no further notice
of Mr Forster or myself, and the conversation,
after several ineffectual attempts to
draw her into it, was kept up between us
alone. Meanwhile, I could not help stealing
an occasional glance to where my wife’s
cousin sat, calm and silent, gazing on the
bright glancing waters, and answering the
occasional remarks directed to her with a
smile which was almost too faint to be
called so. Only once did I see the expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
of her face change; and that was when
the cross-current caught the boat and drove
it all slanting and edgeways, like a bird
across the bay, with a velocity which, for
the moment, considerably unsettled each of
us. She grew a little paler then, and I saw
her hand (rather a nice hand, by-the-bye)
grasp the seat which she occupied; but
still she said nothing.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be frightened, Miss Anstruther,’
I interposed hastily; ‘there is no real
danger. The native boatmen are so skilful
that it is very seldom a boat is upset here.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ she murmured, in answer
to my information, and for a moment her
eyes met mine (she has fine eyes, certainly);
and the next time the boat was driven out
of her course I saw, by the unmoved expression
of her face, that she remained at
ease.</p>

<p>I suppose it was very courageous, and
all that sort of thing; but I don’t think I
liked her any the better for it. A woman,
in my idea, is a creature to be protected,
and not to take care of herself. I remember
how Janie shrieked and screamed and
clung to me when I brought her on shore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
in one of those very boats; and I think I
should have liked it better if Miss Anstruther
had exhibited a little more fear.
However, everybody is not like my Janie.
When we landed at the fort, Forster, who
is our adjutant, was obliged to leave us,
and allow me to take my guest home in a
carriage; but though she talked a little
more when we found ourselves alone, she
was anything but sociable; and I was
thankful when we had turned into our own
compound, and I could tell her to look
out for Janie on the steps. There was my
little bird, of course; all fluttering with
pleasure at the delight of meeting her
cousin again; and as soon as Miss Anstruther
had reached the porch she flew
into her arms, and her happiness found
vent in a burst of excited tears. I expected
to see the stranger follow suit,
knowing that women often cry most when
they are most pleased; but not a drop fell
from her eyes. She clasped my wife very
closely to her, it is true, and I saw her lip
and nostril twitching; but she showed no
further signs of emotion, though Janie did
tell me that, after they had passed into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
bedroom together, her cousin indulged in
what she technically termed ‘a good cry.’
However, of this I knew nothing. The
two girls (Janie is but eighteen, and Miss
Anstruther a year older) remained closeted
together for more than an hour; and when
they reappeared at the breakfast-table they
looked as fresh as their muslin dresses,
and as far from tears as the day was from
rain.</p>

<p>And now, what am I to say of Miss
Anstruther’s personal appearance? She
is certainly very different from what I
imagined—altogether different. I will acknowledge
so far; and yet I don’t know if
I am agreeably surprised in her or not.
She is tall and slight, though not at all
thin, with a lithe figure which reminds
me of a leopard or some such animal; and
every time she moves I expect to see her
take a waving serpentine leap which shall
land her noiselessly on the opposite side
of the room; which peculiarity brings so
forcibly to my mind her nickname of
‘Lionne’ that I have very nearly called
her by it more than once to-day. Her
complexion is pale and sallow (Janie calls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
it ‘creamy’—so I suppose that is the right
name for it), and her eyes, which are
enormous (much too big, in my opinion;
I dislike startling eyes in animals or
women), are black, and very variable in
their expression. Her nose is straight,
and rather sharp; and she has an absurdly
short upper lip, with a deep channel in the
centre of it—in fact, scarcely any upper
lip at all. But she has a pretty set of
teeth (I record this fact to show that I
am not permitting myself to be in the
least swayed by prejudice), and apparently
a large quantity of dark hair—at least
Janie tells me that when unbound it
reaches to her knees.</p>

<p>Still, although doubtless she can boast
of some good features, to call such a
woman beautiful is absurd; and one has
only to see her stand side by side with my
rosebud wife to perceive the worse points
which she possesses. It brings out at
once, as I made Janie laugh by observing,
all the yellow that is in her. She is not
so plain, perhaps, as I expected; but
‘beautiful’ is the last epithet I should
apply to Margaret Anstruther. No woman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
who is not fair can possibly be pretty; and
how any man can <i>prefer</i> a dark face is to
me inexplicable.</p>

<p><i>June 18th.</i>—She certainly is a most
extraordinary girl, and even more disagreeable
than I thought her yesterday.
We really got on so well together the first
day; she chatted so pleasantly during the
forenoon to Janie and myself, and sung to
us in the evening (she has not got a bad
voice by any means), that I began to think
I had made a mistake about her cold, reserved
manner, and that if her visit were
to last for six weeks instead of six months,
it might not prove such an affliction. And
so, wishing to make myself agreeable, I
told Janie this morning at breakfast that
she must be sure and order a very good
dinner, as I intended to ask some of my
brother officers to dine with us. I knew
that Forster and others were anxious to
make Miss Anstruther’s acquaintance; and
a bright thought struck me this morning,
that if I manage well we may get her engaged
and married, and out of the way
altogether in the course of a month. Of
course, it will be a great deal of bother;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
but it will be much better to get it over in
that manner than to have it spun out for
several months, and to wind up perhaps
with a wedding after all. So I have determined
to be very hospitable, and keep
open house for the next few weeks; and
I sha’n’t let Janie interfere with her cousin
in any way; and we will see what that
will do. My wife opened her blue eyes
when I informed her of the impending
guests, and said no one had called on Miss
Anstruther yet.</p>

<p>‘Of what consequence is that?’ I said.
‘The whole regiment will call this morning,
and I know they will be dying for an invitation
afterwards;’ and I nodded in a
knowing manner at Miss Anstruther, as
much as to say that I knew all about it.</p>

<p>‘I hope you do not invite them on my account,’
she said, curtly, answering my look.</p>

<p>‘I invite them on their own, Miss Anstruther.
You do not seem to know your
value. Young ladies are very scarce in
Mushin-Bunda; you could not have come
to a better place, if you want to have it
all your own way. I don’t think you will
find a rival here.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>‘A glorious thought to goad one on to
victory,’ she said, sarcastically, and her
manner seemed to change from that moment.
She became again reserved and
haughty; and when I returned home from
my professional duties, Janie met me almost
in tears, with the intelligence that she was
sure dear Lionne was not well, for she had
scarcely spoken a word all day, and had
sat so silent during the visits of the officers
of the regiment that Janie had had all the
talking to do.</p>

<p>‘Never mind!’ I answered soothingly;
‘she will be different after dinner. A glass
of champagne will thaw her reserve, and
draw her out of herself.’</p>

<p>‘But I so much wished that they should
admire her,’ said dear little Janie in a
despondent voice.</p>

<p>My predictions, however, with respect
to Miss Anstruther were not verified. She
looked very handsome this evening in a
sweeping white dress (‘handsome’ is the
correct term of her style of beauty; no
one could call her ‘pretty,’ like Janie for
instance, but she certainly looks handsome,
particularly by candle-light), but nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
prevailed to make her sociable; neither
my champagne nor my wife’s coaxing
could induce her to talk or sing as she
did last night. She spoke in monosyllables,
and professed herself too tired
for any display; and the five men whom
I had asked to dine with us sat alternately
talking to my wife, and staring at
her guest, until the time for their departure
had arrived. Janie sung us two or three
ballads in her sweet plaintive little voice,
but we had heard them before, of course,
and should have been glad of something
new. But all our pressing and entreaty
were in vain. Miss Anstruther said she
was too fatigued to sing; and declining
even to sit amongst the company, stood
by a window gazing out upon the night.
Presently, almost too vexed at her singular
behaviour to remember my politeness, I
approached her side, and said, perhaps
rather abruptly,—</p>

<p>‘Why won’t you sing for us?’</p>

<p>‘Because I don’t choose,’ she answered,
fearlessly.</p>

<p>‘I thought so,’ I said; and turning
away I quitted her again, and took a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
seat by Janie’s side. But after a while
some fascination, for which I am unable
to account (but which has been felt at
times by all people who on earth do
dwell), made me feel that Miss Anstruther
was regarding me, and lifting my eyes, I
encountered the glance of hers fixed on
my face. She withdrew them quickly;
but not before their gaze had made me
feel uncomfortable—a sensation which I
attribute to the fact of their colour, which
I have never liked, and believe I never
shall.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening passed dully
enough, and I am sure Janie was as relieved
as I was when our friends rose to
take their leave, and Miss Anstruther
disappeared in the privacy of her own
room.</p>

<p>‘You can’t say that Mademoiselle Lionne
has made herself very agreeable to-night,’
I exclaimed rather triumphantly, as Janie
and I found ourselves alone.</p>

<p>But Janie was hardly a subject to be
triumphed over, she was so very humble
and apologetic.</p>

<p>‘I can’t think what is the matter with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
her, Robert dear; but I assure you she
is not sulky. Only this moment she put
her arms round my neck and kissed me—oh,
so nicely! but I don’t think she likes
dinner-parties. We won’t give another.’</p>

<p>‘Not like dinner-parties!’ I exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘No—nor men. She told me she
wouldn’t sit in the drawing-room to-morrow
morning.’</p>

<p>‘Not like dinner-parties or men!’ I exclaimed,
aghast at the intelligence. ‘And
how the deuce is she to get married,
then?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps she doesn’t want to get married,’
said Janie demurely.</p>

<p>‘Doesn’t want to get married!’ I growled.
‘Don’t tell me such nonsense! If she
doesn’t want to get married, what is she
out here for?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, hush! Robert dear; don’t speak
so loud,’ interposed my wife, as she laid
her little hand across my mouth. ‘Do
remember, her room is the next one to
this.’</p>

<p>So the conference was stopped, and I
cut into my dressing-room to write my
diary. But I never heard such nonsense,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
and I wouldn’t believe it on the girl’s
own oath. Not like men or dinner-parties,
forsooth! It is only a young lady’s trick
to attract attention by appearing to decline
it. We shall never get rid of her at this
rate.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>—Her eyes are not black. I was
mistaken. They are grey, and not such
a very dark grey either, except when she
is annoyed. It is only in some lights
that they look black. They are fine eyes;
but more suited, I should think, to war
than love.</p>

<p><i>June 19th.</i>—In some way or other I
have offended my lady, for she will hardly
speak to me; and when I proposed to
drive her to hear the regimental band
play this evening (Janie not being well),
rejected my offer with a decision which
amounted to scorn. Yet she stayed by
Janie’s sofa (so I was told afterwards)
during the whole term of my absence,
bathing her head with eau de Cologne, and
fanning her, and attending to all her wants
in the most womanly manner; so I suppose
she has some good in her, after all.
But so have serpents and tigers, and other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
beasts of prey. All I know is, that I’m
not going to be insulted by a girl in my
own house, and I shall let Miss Anstruther
feel this by keeping up a distance between
us, and treating her with the coldest reserve.
Just when I had been forcing
myself to show her politeness, in spite of
all the repulsion I feel to her society, to
have my offer rudely rejected is more
than any man can stand. It makes my
blood boil to recall the tone in which she
told me she was ‘infinitely obliged,’ but
thought, on the whole, she would rather
‘remain at home.’ She may remain at
home for ever for me now; it will be a
long time before I offer to take her out
again.</p>

<p><i>June 21st.</i>—We have been at it now for
two days, bowing to each other when we
meet, and scarcely exchanging a word
except in the most formal manner. Janie
sees the change, of course, and is wretched
about it. She keeps turning her wistful
glances from one to the other, as if to entreat
us to make it up and be friends; but when
she appeals to me in private, I tell her that
it is the fault of her cousin, who is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
one to make the first advances towards
reconciliation, as I have not the slightest
idea in what I have offended; and when
she talks in her turn to Lionne, I believe
she hears pretty much the same argument.
I hope, however, for all our sakes, that
this kind of thing won’t go on much longer;
for I know that it’s deucedly disagreeable,
and that I’ve never felt at home since Miss
Anstruther came into the house.</p>

<p><i>June 23d.</i>—Colonel Anstruther has sent
up a fine Arab from Madras for the use
of his niece, and to-day it arrived under
the charge of its native groom, rather
foot-worn and travel-stained, but otherwise
in good condition. It is such a beautiful
creature, and my fancy for horses is so
strong, that I really couldn’t help coming
a little out of my shell on its arrival, and
expressing my admiration of its various
points to its mistress. She also seemed
to forget herself in her pleasure in the
new acquisition; but when I remarked
that she would now have some delightful
rides, and would find no lack of cavaliers
to accompany her in Mushin-Bunda, the
old expression re-gathered on her face,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
and she retreated to the house, and sat
for the greater part of the evening in her
own room. What an unpleasant woman!
I would rather she bit me than treated
me like this, and suggested to Janie that
the alternative would be pleasant for a
change. But Janie wouldn’t laugh; she
is too really unhappy about the state of
things.</p>

<p><i>June 25th.</i>—Matters remained <i>in statu
quo</i> until to-day; but the thaw has come
at last, and, as it should do, from the
female side. The horses were brought
round this morning, as usual, to eat their
‘gram’ in front of the house; and the
Arab, having enjoyed two days’ rest and
a thorough grooming, looked in such good
condition, that Janie was eager in her
entreaties that her cousin should take her
first ride on him this evening, and form
an opinion of her new acquisition. Knowing
that my attendance would be necessary
(I have never been able to persuade Janie
to become a horsewoman, she is far too
timid), I made an effort to be more agreeable,
and joined my persuasions to those
of my wife; but Miss Anstruther would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
give no definite answer, and rather put
the question to one side than otherwise;
so I thought no more about it. Going
towards the stables, however, in the afternoon,
I saw the Arab standing ready
saddled in his stall; and hearing it was
by order of the ‘missy,’ concluded that
I had either misunderstood her reticence,
or she had changed her mind; so, telling
the horsekeeper to get my animal also
ready, returned to the house to hear what
plans had been made in my absence.
There I found Miss Anstruther standing
by herself in the verandah, ready attired
for her ride, and looking better in her hat
and habit than I remember to have seen
her look before.</p>

<p>‘Janie has a headache, Captain Norton,
and is lying down until dinner time. I
believe she is asleep,’ she said, as she
observed the roving look I cast about in
search of my wife.</p>

<p>‘Ah, poor little woman, it will be the
best thing for her,’ I replied. ‘The horses
will be round directly, Miss Anstruther;
but I am sorry you did not make me
understand your intention of riding more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
plainly; it was quite by chance that I
returned home so early.’</p>

<p>At this she turned and regarded me
with serious surprise.</p>

<p>‘I had no intention of troubling you,’
she said quickly; ‘I can ride by myself.’</p>

<p>‘By yourself, and on a strange animal,
Miss Anstruther! It is quite out of the
question.’</p>

<p>‘I have ridden all sorts of animals.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps; but not without an attendant.
What would the regiment think to see you
riding alone?’</p>

<p>‘I am sorry, I have mistaken the place,’
she said gravely. ‘I thought Mushin-Bunda
was so very quiet that one might
do anything here. I should not think of
troubling you to accompany me.’</p>

<p>And she turned towards the house as
though with the intention of giving up her
ride. But I placed myself upon the threshold,
and barred her entrance.</p>

<p>‘You have not been treating me fairly
for some days past, Miss Anstruther.
What have I done to offend you?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing,’ she answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>‘Then don’t add insult to your injury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
by refusing my escort on this occasion.
You need take no more notice of me,
you know, than if I were your groom;
and that will not be much alteration from
your usual behaviour.’</p>

<p>She held her head so low that I could
hardly see her face; but she re-entered the
verandah as I spoke, and I concluded that
my terms were accepted. In another moment
the horses were at the door.</p>

<p>‘Come,’ I said, as gaily as I could, as
I held out my hand to aid her in descending
the steps; and as I took hers, I felt
that it was trembling. I put her on her
horse. Notwithstanding her height, she
is almost feather-weight; and her elastic
figure sprang into the saddle, from the
impetus it received from me, as though
she had really been the animal to which
I am so fond of comparing her. So I
settled her in her seat, arranging her skirt
and stirrup-leather for her, and handing
her the reins, without once looking in her
face; and then I mounted my own horse,
and we rode out of the compound side
by side. The silence that we maintained
was ominous. She did not speak a word,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
and I could think of nothing to say, although
I felt that an explanation was about
to take place between us. I was glad,
therefore, when we came to a long strip
of green turf, and I could suggest that
she should try of what mettle her animal
was made; a suggestion to which she
dumbly assented by breaking into a canter.
As we rode along together, I glanced at
her light figure, poised like a bird upon
the saddle, and saw that she rode well,
sitting home to her crupper, and handling
her reins as though she were accustomed
to them.</p>

<p>(<i>N.B.</i>—I have read and heard a good
deal about the want of grace in a woman’s
seat on horseback, but, for my own part,
I never think a lady looks so well as
in that position, always provided that she
understands her business and has a figure
worth looking at. A handsome woman on
a handsome horse is a sight for royalty,
and I never know which to admire most,
the mortal or the equine.)</p>

<p>We cantered for a mile or more, and the
action of the Arab seemed very perfect.
I made an observation to this effect, when,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
having left the running horse-keepers far
behind us, we at last drew rein, and found
ourselves alone. But still my remark
received no answer, and I was determined
to make her speak.</p>

<p>‘Am I intruding too much upon my
privileges, Miss Anstruther, in venturing
an opinion on the subject? Even a groom
is sometimes permitted, you know, to pass
his judgment on the new acquisitions to
his mistress’s stables.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t, Captain Norton; oh, pray,
don’t.’</p>

<p>The words were uttered so hurriedly
that I scarcely understood them; but
when I looked into her face for an explanation,
I saw that she was crying. Now I
cannot bear to see a woman cry. They
may do anything they like with me—tease,
bully, even insult me—so long as they keep
their eyes dry; but Miss Anstruther’s
tears were falling fast upon the bosom of
her riding-habit.</p>

<p>I could not endure to think that she
might be annoyed with me and my
bantering; perhaps unhappy at having to
live at Mushin-Bunda, for it is a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
dull and uninteresting place; and I said
the first thing which came into my head.</p>

<p>‘My dear girl, what <i>is</i> the matter with
you?’</p>

<p>I suppose the question was stupid or
ill-timed, or perhaps I don’t understand
the ways of women, for instead of doing
Miss Anstruther any good, it changed her
silent tears into such a storm of grief
that I was quite alarmed. I have often
seen Janie cry (indeed, my little woman
is rather fond of working her hydraulics
on very small occasions), and I have been
the unwilling witness at times to a good
many tears from various members of the
fair sex; but never in all my life have I
seen such a tempest of passionate rain as
poured from Margaret Anstruther’s eyes
this evening. She sobbed so violently
and with so little restraint, that I began to
be alarmed for the effect of her emotion,
both on her horse and herself, and begged
and entreated her to be calm, when all of
a sudden, to my astonishment, the storm
passed as quickly as it had arisen; and,
except for her heaving bosom and sobbing
breath, she was herself again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>‘What must you think of me?’ she inquired,
turning her liquid eyes, still swimming
in tears, upon my countenance. ‘I
must have seemed so rude, so ungrateful
to you both.’</p>

<p>‘Think!’ I stammered, remembering
all I have thought of her conduct during
the last few days; ‘I don’t think anything,
Miss Anstruther; only I am afraid you
cannot be happy with us or here.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it is not that!’ she exclaimed
earnestly. ‘Neither place nor people can
make any difference to me. Dear Janie
is everything that is kind; and you—you
have been very patient with me—but
nothing can lift off the humiliation, the
degradation, that I feel in being here
at all.’</p>

<p>‘Degradation!’ I repeated, rather nettled
at the term.</p>

<p>‘Yes, degradation!’ she said emphatically;
‘else why am I in this country?
what is my place in India? I have an
uncle here, it is true; but so have I uncles
in England. Why was Colonel Anstruther
chosen by my guardians as the one most
fitted to offer me a home? Tell me that.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>‘He is rich, and a bachelor,’ I commenced;
‘and living alone, naturally—’</p>

<p>‘It is not so,’ she interrupted me; ‘and
you know it, Captain Norton. It is because
he lives in a country where women
are scarce, and men have few opportunities
of choice; where a girl may pick up a
husband who might remain for ever unmarried
at home; where we are looked at
on arrival much as though we were articles
of sale, and often purchased for motives
unworthy the name of love or honour or
esteem. You cannot deny it, because it is
true, and I am wretched;’ and with this
Lionne buried her burning face in her
hands.</p>

<p>‘But I can deny it!’ I exclaimed; ‘for
if this is the case with some girls sent out
to this country, it is not with all. Look at
your cousin Janie; surely you would never
speak of her in that strain.’</p>

<p>‘Janie came out to the care of her
sister, her nearest relation,’ was the low
reply.</p>

<p>‘And you have come out to your relations,
Miss Anstruther; to friends who
have but one wish, to see you happy and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
comfortable, and who would never dream
of imputing such motives to an action
which—’</p>

<p>‘Did you not dream of it?’ she retorted
quickly, as she turned her glowing glance
upon me. ‘What was the question that
you put to Janie the second evening of
my arrival. “If she doesn’t want to get
married, what is she here for?” I ought
not to have heard it, perhaps, but you
spoke so loudly that it was impossible
to avoid doing so. And do you think I
didn’t feel it?’</p>

<p>She spoke so decidedly, and yet so mournfully,
her eyes flashed with such proud indignant
fire, whilst her figure seemed bowed
beneath the weight of her humiliation, that
I had nothing to say for myself; and having
attempted some stammering reply, which
ended very abruptly, found that she was
speaking again, though more to herself than
me, and felt myself constrained to be silent
and attend.</p>

<p>‘I saw it from the first day I landed,’ she
went on sadly. ‘I perceived in Mrs Grant’s
insinuations, and the remarks of her lady
friends, that I was supposed to have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
sent out to India with but one object—to
get a husband; and it sickened me. But
when I came here,’ she added in a lower
voice, ‘I hoped it would be different; I
hoped that you and Janie, being so lately
married, would look on love and marriage
in a holier light—as something too far
removed from earthly calculations to be
made the subject of mere speculation or
convenience.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Miss Anstruther, forgive me!’ I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘It is I who should have said those
words, Captain Norton. You disappointed
me, and I have disappointed
you. You raised in me a demon of a
temper, which I should have been ashamed
to manifest, which I am now most heartily
ashamed even to recall. And you have
been very patient with me, very good and
very gentlemanly. Please forgive me, in
your turn.’</p>

<p>And she placed her hand firmly and
warmly into mine.</p>

<p>‘You are too kind,’ I stammered, confused
beyond measure at this rapid change of
manner in my guest. ‘I spoke thoughtlessly;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
but I see that I misjudged you. Only tell
me now what you wish to be done, and I
will execute it to the letter.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t deserve that you should do anything,
Captain Norton, but hate me for a
rude and sulky wretch; but I am so heartily
sorry to have annoyed you.’</p>

<p>‘Let us forget all that,’ I responded,
earnestly; ‘the annoyance was mutual, and
I was the most to blame. Only tell me
what to do in future, Margaret—I may call
you Margaret, may I not, since we are
cousins?—in order to make you happy,
and then I shall feel that I am quite
forgiven.’</p>

<p>‘Treat me as a human being,’ she answered,
gaily, ‘and not as an animal for
sale. Don’t ask your brother officers to
the house on my account, nor thrust me
forward for their contemplation in any way.
Look on me as what I am: a creature who
may stand alone all her life, and be contented
so to stand; to whom marriage is but a
chance in the future; so great a chance
indeed, and so undesired a certainty, that
she does not even care to contemplate it
nearer; to whom her friends, if they will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
be her true and honest friends, are more
valuable than a score of admirers.’</p>

<p>‘Whatever I have been, you shall have
a true and honest friend in me henceforward,
Margaret.’</p>

<p>‘That’s right; so let us look upon our
difference as settled, and make Janie’s heart
glad by the beaming faces we take back
with us. And now, let me hear your true
opinion of my uncle’s present to me.’</p>

<p>We discoursed gaily on in different topics
till we reached home; when Janie was
indeed made glad (as Margaret had predicted)
by the cheerful conversation we
maintained at the dinner-table, and the
little bit of confidence I reposed in her
when we found ourselves alone. She was
so delighted to think I should appreciate
her dear Lionne at her true value at last.
Not that I told Janie every word that had
passed between her cousin and myself; for,
added to its being unnecessary, I am not
sure that my little girl would understand
Miss Anstruther’s feelings on the subject,
or properly respect her pride. She would
mention it again to her probably; and in
her simplicity, wishing to be kind and interested,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
try to sift her reasons to the
bottom, and perhaps annoy where she
desired to please. So I only said that our
quarrel was altogether done away with,
and would never be renewed; and that, as
her cousin seemed to prefer a quiet life,
we would inaugurate no farther dinner-parties
on her account; which would suit
us better, I concluded, and be more in
accordance with our usual style of living.
To all which my wife heartily agreed; and
I feel more at charity with myself and
all mankind than I have done for some
time past. I shall keep my word with
Margaret Anstruther; and extend no
farther encouragement to the bachelors
who may come lounging about my house.
It is a strange taste on her part; but she
must be a girl in a thousand to dislike
admiration, and to look upon careless attentions
as an offence against the solemnity
of marriage. It <i>is</i> a solemn thing, when
you come to think, that if you make a
mistake upon the subject, you are in for
it, and nothing can pull you out again.
I wonder if Margaret has had an unrequited
attachment; I should not be in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
the least surprised were I told so; it
would be quite in accordance with the
grave, melancholy expression of her eyes,
and her dislike to society. I must try
and discover.</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-j.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><i>July 20th</i>.—Is it possible that I
can have let nearly a whole
month slip away without writing
a line in my diary? I had no
idea of it till I saw the last date inscribed
here; and the month itself seems to have
gone so swiftly, that had it not been for
this reminder, I should have imagined
it was not more than a week since I
recorded my experiences. I suppose it
is the monotony of the place which makes
the time go so fast. My poor little Janie
has not been well during this month:
the heat has been unusually trying, and
she lies on her sofa half the day, suffering
from nervous headaches, and a general
disinclination to get up and do anything.
In this emergency her cousin has been
invaluable; she is constantly by her side,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
reading to her, writing her letters, or
amusing her with quiet conversation; indeed,
I may say we share the duty, for,
of course, I like to wait on Janie; and
the novels which Margaret brought out
from England with her are very entertaining
to listen to, and to me an entirely new
field of fancy, as I have scarcely ever
looked into a work of fiction in my life.
I imagined novels, particularly modern
ones, were such rubbish; and so I suppose
they are. Yet, on a hot day, and
when there is nothing else to do, it is very
pleasant to sit still, fanning Janie and
listening to Margaret’s mellow voice as
she reads them to us. We are engaged
upon the <i>Newcomes</i> at present. I pity
that poor devil Clive, with such a little
fool as Rosy for a wife, and especially
when he might have had a girl like Ethel
Newcome. I didn’t care a pin about the
story at first, but I feel quite interested in
it now, and anxious to know if he gets rid
of Rosy by any means, so that he may
marry the other. I think it will be very
hard lines if he doesn’t. Margaret laughs
at me, and says I am a bloodthirsty monster,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
and that Clive should be made to
abide the consequences of his folly; and
so, I suppose, by rights he should.</p>

<p>What a genial laugh she has, and how
pleasant it is to see her blush and smile!
I can understand now what Janie means
by calling her complexion creamy; it is
so smooth and equable, not easily flushed,
but at the same time not liable to become
florid and irritable-looking, which is so
often the case with fair skins. We have
certainly had some very quiet peaceful
days together. I have faithfully kept the
compact I made with her to be her friend,
and I think she appreciates my wish to give
her pleasure. We have had no parties
since she expressed a contrary desire, and
I have even told Forster—who is evidently
most absurdly spoony on her—that she
does not favour his suit—as I can see by
her manner towards him—and that he
really must not come to the house so often.
He says, ‘Why not let him try his luck?’
but I am firm in making him understand
that trial would only end in disappointment
for himself. He grumbles; so do
several others; but my wife’s state of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
health is sufficient excuse for our not
entertaining at present. I told Margaret
of what I had said to Forster relative
to her not liking his attentions, and she
blushed so crimson that I stopped in alarm
to ask if I had done wrong; but she assured
me to the contrary, and that she
does not like the man. I have not had
a good opportunity yet of probing her
concerning that former attachment of
which I am suspicious; but I fancy I see
signs of it almost every day; also that she
has somehow guessed at my intentions,
for I am sure she has avoided being alone
with me lately. Notwithstanding all which
we are very happy, and Lionne is very
different from what I expected her to be.
She has not been in a temper once since
we arrived at that mutual understanding.</p>

<p><i>July 21st.</i>—Talk of the old gentleman,
they say, and he is sure to appear. I
hope I did not raise the slumbering demon
in Miss Anstruther’s breast by my innocent
remark of last night; but she has
certainly given us a peep of him since.</p>

<p>I was sitting in my own room this
afternoon, occupied with some official<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
papers, when I heard a confusion of
tongues in the compound, and Janie’s
frightened voice, in tones of agitation,
entreating me to go to her assistance. I
ran, of course, to find that the cause of her
alarm was a loud altercation going on between
Miss Anstruther and some natives
in the back verandah.</p>

<p>‘Oh, do go to them, Robert dear!’
Janie plaintively exclaimed; ‘Lionne is so
angry, and I can’t think what for.’</p>

<p>I dashed upon the scene of action, and
took in the circumstances at a glance. In
the centre stood Lionne—a <i>lionne</i> indeed,
looking—I could not help observing it,
even whilst I blamed the exhibition—most
beautiful under the influence of her rage.
Her dark face glowing with passion, her
arm extended, though powerless to command
attention, and her lips pouring forth
a torrent of generous indignant words,
alike uncomprehended and unheeded by
those around her. By her side stood two
or three servants, who stared at the lady’s
vehemence without attempting to execute
her wishes; whilst before her, in the compound
was a group of natives actively employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
in torturing a poor pariah dog by
methods too horrible to relate, and only
abating their cruelty to exchange significant
grins and glances with one another at
Lionne’s impotent rage. But my appearance
amongst them had the effect of an
electric shock upon the herd.</p>

<p>‘What is all this about?’ I demanded
angrily of my servants. ‘How dare you
let such a scene go on in my compound?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Robert! Robert!’ exclaimed
Lionne—it is the first time in her life that
she has called me by my Christian name—‘stop
them; make them leave off such
horrid cruelty. I did not know you were
at home, or I would have sent for you
before.’</p>

<p>The natives had already shrunk back
and huddled together, whilst the unfortunate
victim of their experiments still lay
panting on the sand before us.</p>

<p>‘Oh, look at it! look at it!’ she cried
excitedly; ‘it is in agony; it is dying!
Oh, you wretches! you inhuman, barbarous
savages!’ with an expression and
emphasis which must have made even her
English phrases intelligible to the creatures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
she addressed; ‘I should like to see every
one of you served in the same way. You
are not men, you are devils!’</p>

<p>‘Lionne,’ I said firmly, as I laid my
hand on the excited girl’s arm, ‘this is no
place for you. Leave me to deal with
these men by myself.’</p>

<p>She shook off my grasp impatiently, as
though disdaining my control; but I caught
her eye and chained it.</p>

<p>‘Margaret!’</p>

<p>‘But, Captain Norton—’</p>

<p>‘Go in to Janie—you have frightened
her enough already—and leave me by
myself. I will come to you by-and-by.’</p>

<p>She saw I was in earnest, and with a
heightened colour turned from the verandah
and re-entered the house, where, after having
severely reprimanded my servants,
thrashed one or two of the natives, and
seen the tortured animal put out of its
misery, I followed her. She was seated
by Janie’s couch, her hand clasped in that
of her cousin, her beautiful head drooped
and lowering. I saw that she was ashamed
of what had passed; and so I made no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
reference to it, but asked my wife in an
indifferent tone on what she had decided
to do this evening. She had decided on
nothing—in fact, she wished to do nothing,
but to be left to lie still in peace. So, after
a while, I proposed a stroll in the compound
to Miss Anstruther; and she rose to her
feet and prepared to follow me.</p>

<p>I think I have already spoken of our
compound, which is full of graves. These
graves are very inconveniently situated for
a gentleman’s pleasure-grounds; or perhaps
it would be more correct to say that the
gentleman’s pleasure-grounds are inconveniently
situated for the graves, which
stretch up to the very windows of the
house, and by their inequality greatly impede
the facility of a stroll. We stumbled over
them, and made circuits round about them,
for some time in silence, until both that and
the exercise seemed to become oppressive;
and by mutual consent, as it were, we sat
down together on a broad flat stone which
covers one of them; and for a few moments
neither of us spoke. Then I stole
a glance at Margaret’s face, and saw that
it was still clouded and downcast; and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
felt a strange longing to see it brighten up
again and smile upon me.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry you should have been witness
to so painful and disgraceful a scene,
Miss Anstruther,’ I ventured to remark.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry you should have been witness
to so painful and disgraceful a scene,
Captain Norton,’ she echoed gloomily.
‘Mine was the worst exhibition of the two:
I see it now plainly. Oh, what a wretch
you must think me! What an undisciplined,
passionate, unwomanly creature!’
and up went her hands as shelter to her
burning face.</p>

<p>‘Please don’t call yourself names; I can’t
subscribe to them. I think you only what
you are—a generous, warm-hearted girl,
indignant at the sight of wrong, only inclined
to be a little too hot and hasty in
expressing your indignation. Never be
afraid of falling in my good opinion by
showing your true nature, Margaret.’</p>

<p>‘But my nature is so bad, Captain Norton;
you cannot think how bad it is. My
temper is so violent; and when it rises, I
remember nothing else, except that I am
angry and must show it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>‘If you never display it in a worse cause,
Margaret, than you did this afternoon, you
cannot go far wrong. It was a disgraceful
and disgusting act of cruelty.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, was it not cruel,’ she eagerly exclaimed,
‘to torture one so utterly defenceless
and unarmed? I could look on at
men, or dogs, or any creatures of equal
power, fighting with each other, and applaud
the victor; but when it comes to one against
such fearful odds, one innocent creature
suffering because of its innocence, I cannot
bear it. Many such sights would kill me;
I think that I should burst with rage.’</p>

<p>‘And yet in this world, Margaret, it is
usually the defenceless and the innocent
who suffer.’</p>

<p>‘We who are strong should shield them,’
she answered, hastily.</p>

<p>I wonder what made her link her nature
with mine in that word ‘we?’ And yet I
feel that I am strong—as she is. The
tombstone on which we were sitting professes
to cover the remains of two lovers
who died within a few hours of each other.
I told her the story, as it has been related
to me by one of our officers, who has taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
the trouble to decipher the old Dutch letters
upon the stone, and asked her if she believed
it possible that grief could have such an
effect as to kill within so short a space of
time.</p>

<p>‘It seems unlikely,’ she replied indifferently;
‘but natures are so various.
If true, she must have loved him very
devotedly.’</p>

<p>‘And you are the last person to believe
in such affection,’ I remarked. I thought
it would be a good occasion to find out if
she had ever had an unfortunate attachment.</p>

<p>‘What makes you think so?’ she answered
quickly.</p>

<p>‘Because you have never tried it—have
you? You have never been in love yourself,
Margaret?’</p>

<p>I spoke laughingly; but I wish I had
not mentioned it. A scarlet flush mounted
to her very forehead as I said the words;
and when I pulled her by the hand and
repeated my assertion, she burst into tears,
and ran from me to the house. What a
fool I was to touch on such a subject! I
don’t believe, all the same, that it is true,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
that she has ever been in love; but I may
have wounded her sensitive pride by mentioning
it, and cause her to be reserved
with me in future. Indeed, I am sure that
she behaved more distantly towards me
even during the remainder of the evening;
and a little circumstance which happened
just before we went to bed confirms me in
this opinion.</p>

<p>Janie was quite brisk and lively compared
to what she has been lately, and
sung us several songs; but Lionne excused
herself from singing, and remained
in a corner with her face buried in a
book.</p>

<p>‘Make her come, Robert dear,’ said
Janie playfully. ‘Go and pull her out.’</p>

<p>‘Captain Norton knows better than to
attempt such a rudeness,’ was the measured
reply, which fell rather as a wet blanket on
the other little woman’s mirth.</p>

<p>‘Why do you call him Captain Norton?’
she said, pouting. ‘You called him Robert
this afternoon when you were in the verandah,
Lionne, because I heard you. Why
can’t you do so always?’</p>

<p>Miss Anstruther had disappeared still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
lower behind her book; but to my wife’s
demand she made no reply.</p>

<p>‘Why won’t you call him Robert?’ said
Janie, as she rose from the piano and took
possession of her cousin’s book; ‘he always
calls you Margaret.’</p>

<p>The face which she thus disclosed was
crimson, and the dark eyes swam in a
blurred mist which was half tears. So
painful indeed was the expression of the
whole countenance, that I turned away, and
could not contemplate it.</p>

<p>‘Because I can’t, I really can’t,’ was the
reply at last extracted.</p>

<p>‘And why not?’ persisted Janie.</p>

<p>‘It is not pleasant to me; I do not wish
it,’ said Miss Anstruther, until I felt myself
constrained to interfere, and desire
Janie not to tease her cousin.</p>

<p>So she released the glowing face with an
expression of impatience at her obstinacy,
and Miss Anstruther made use of her
liberty by effecting an immediate disappearance.
This confirms me in my impression
that I offended her in the compound
this evening, and that it will cause a difference
in our future intercourse. I am very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
much vexed about it: I had really begun
quite to like the girl. And I cannot dismiss
from my mind the tone in which she
said the words, ‘We who are strong should
shelter them.’ Does she imagine that I
am not capable of acting a generous part?
I should like to have some opportunity of
showing her what stuff I am made of.</p>

<p><i>July 30th.</i>—I have been very much vexed
to-day; and though the circumstance appears
trifling, it threatens to lead to serious
results. When we first arrived in Mushin-Bunda—now
some eight months ago—I,
in common with others of my regiment,
heard several absurd stories concerning
the houses supposed to be haunted in the
cantonment and its neighbourhood—(natives
always have a stock of such lies
on hand, with which to feed the imagination
of any one fool enough to listen to
them); but of course I placed no credence
in their statements, which only excited a
smile from their stupidity. <i>This</i> well was
said to be the quarters of a devil, for which
cause no one would ever draw or use the
water from it; and <i>that</i> clump of bamboos
to harbour another, which, issuing in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
form of a boa-constrictor, attacked those
who were hardy enough to linger in the
compound after dark. With regard to our
own house, I heard that the spirits of the
dead who lay buried beneath our windows
had been seen to wander about at night
in their grave-clothes; but of course I took
care that such rubbish should not reach
the ears of my wife; equally of course I
forbade my servants chattering about it,
and never gave the subject another thought.
What was my surprise and vexation, therefore,
when I returned home this afternoon,
to find my wife supported by her cousin
in a state of hysterical agitation, whilst
she listened to the garbled statements of
half-a-dozen natives, who all talked together,
and interrupted one another, and
did everything they could to render their
relation as confused and unintelligible as
possible. My ‘chokra’ or ‘dressing-boy’
was gesticulating in Hindustani; the butler
was vociferating in broken English; and the
cook in his native tongue of Tamil; whilst
the ‘maty’ and tailor and ‘cook-boy’
tripped over each other in any words they
could first lay hold of. Margaret was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
looking incredulous and a little scornful;
Janie was all tears and flushed cheeks and
wide-open eyes; and for the moment I
was struck speechless with astonishment
to think what could possibly have happened
during my absence.</p>

<p>‘What is all this about?’ I exclaimed,
as I advanced to the centre of the group.</p>

<p>The servants fell back, conscious they
had no business there, and evidently somewhat
doubtful of my reception of their
news. But Margaret gave a sigh of relief
at my appearance, and Janie flew to my
arms as to an ark of safety.</p>

<p>‘These men have been frightening Janie
out of her wits,’ said Margaret in a tone
of annoyance; ‘and all I could say was
insufficient to stop them.’</p>

<p>‘What is it, my dear?’ said I, addressing
my wife. ‘What have they told you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh Robert, do take me away!’ she
answered with a convulsive shudder. ‘I
never shall be able to sleep in this house
again. They say they have seen it: a
dreadful thing all in white, walking about
the graves, and moaning to itself, and
wringing its hands. Oh, Robert dear, do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
let us go! It will come into the house
next; I am sure it will. I shall die of
fright if you don’t take me away at once.’</p>

<p>She clung to me like a terrified child,
and as I marked her burning face and felt
the feverish clasp of her hands, I could not
tell what injury these idiots might not have
done her by their folly.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by this?’ I inquired
sternly, as I turned to the group
of natives.</p>

<p>Then they began to cringe and salaam
before me, as they attempted to repeat
the story which had so alarmed my wife.
But I would not permit them to do so,
but ordered them all out of the room,
and turned my attention towards soothing
Janie’s fears.</p>

<p>‘You must not be a child, my dear
Janie,’ I said, as I replaced her on the
sofa, and arranged her pillows for her.
‘These natives are always full of their
stupid ghost-stories; but you know better
surely than to believe such folly. There
are no such things as ghosts, therefore how
could they have seen one?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but indeed—indeed, Robert, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
true!’ she said with painful earnestness.
‘They saw it themselves only last night,
and they say it is like a woman with long
hair down her back; and when they tried
to touch it, it vanished away.’</p>

<p>At this I could not help laughing.</p>

<p>‘A pack of heroes!’ I exclaimed. ‘Why,
Janie, there is not one amongst them man
enough to inquire into such a mystery,
even if they saw it, which I don’t believe.
I’ve a good mind to give them a hiding
all round to make their eyesight a little
clearer.’</p>

<p>‘But what should be their object in
repeating it?’ inquired Janie fearfully.</p>

<p>‘If you will condescend to listen, my
dear, you will always find them ready to
talk. They are full to the brim with such
idle tales. You should refuse to hear
them, and send them about their business.’</p>

<p>‘Oh but, Robert, can’t we go away from
this house? I never could bear those
graves, and now I shall be more frightened
of them than ever.’</p>

<p>‘Janie, I thought you were more of a
woman,’ I said reproachfully. ‘Where
could we go to? You know that all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
houses in Mushin-Bunda are occupied;’
to which fact poor Janie assented with a
deep sigh.</p>

<p>‘But, at all events, you won’t go out
this evening, Robert, will you?’ she continued
imploringly. ‘I could not bear to
stay in the house alone with Margaret and
that awful thing.’</p>

<p>I was engaged to attend a public dinner
at our mess this evening, for a couple of
officers of the 18th are passing through
Mushin-Bunda on their way to England,
and we wished to show them a little civility.
I had been looking forward to the occasion
(one sees so few strangers in this place);
but I told my poor little timid wife that
I would give it up and remain at home
with her. However, Miss Anstruther
very kindly came to my assistance, and,
begging me to keep my engagement,
promised not to leave Janie for a single
moment till my return. Upon which,
although with much reluctance, the other
consented to my leaving her; and as soon
as I could get away, I went after my
servants to learn what folly had induced
them to fly into the presence of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
mistress with such a rumour. I found
them almost as frightened as herself, and,
oddly enough (for you can generally catch
a native tripping when you cross-examine
him), perfectly firm in adhering to their
first statement. Their story is, that as
three of them were returning to their
godowns (as they call the huts in the
compound) rather late last night, they saw
a tall figure dressed in white wandering
about the graves, and moving its hands
in a distressed manner; and that, as they
cried out at the sight (for natives are
terribly superstitious and cowardly), they
wakened the other three, who ran out
just in time to see the figure vanish round
the house, and they were too much alarmed
to follow up the search. In relating the
story to me they dropped all mention of
having touched the supposed ghost, being
aware, I suppose, that I was not likely
to credit such an act of bravery on their
parts. I spoke to them all six, both together
and individually; and it is curious
that I could not make them contradict
themselves in the statement that they have
seen such an apparition. Of course it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
all nonsense. They saw something doubtless;
most likely Janie’s ‘ayah’ in her
white cloth, out without leave; but as for
a ghost!—folly!</p>

<p>I scolded them well all round for a pack
of idiots, forbade their mentioning the
subject again, and threatened them with
the stick and stoppage of wages if they
were ever the means of carrying such
stories to their mistress’s ears; so I hope
we have heard the last of the ghost.
However, the fright has evidently done
Janie no good. When I returned home
from mess this evening, I found that she
had had another violent attack of hysterics,
and that her cousin had thought right to
send for our doctor, who happened to be
at his own house. He reports my wife
very nervous and feverish, and orders her
to be kept as quiet as possible. I would
give a thousand pounds this moment, if
I had them, sooner than this story had
reached her ears. She is so sensitive and
timid, and her health is at present so delicate,
that I fear the shock may have some
ill effect upon her.</p>

<p><i>July 31st.</i>—Janie better, but still feverish.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
Miss Anstruther watches over her like a
sister. After they had both retired to bed
to-night, I sat at the window for more than
a couple of hours, hoping to see something
which might account for the servants’ story,
but nothing was visible. The bright moon
lit up the compound till it appeared almost
like day, and the air was so still that I
must have heard the slightest rustle; but
I neither saw nor heard anything except
my own breathing and the smoke from
my cigar. What awful fools these niggers
must be to believe in ghosts at all!</p>

<p><i>August 1st.</i>—Janie was on her sofa
again to-day, and so cheerful, that I hope
she has already forgotten her alarm, and
that the remembrance may never be revived.
But what has come to Margaret
Anstruther? She looked so careworn this
afternoon, so haggard and miserable, compared
to her usual appearance, that, after
asking her what was the matter, without
obtaining any satisfactory response, I
ventured to remark that I hoped the
ghost-story had not had any effect on her.
The start which she gave on hearing my
words, and the flush which mounted to her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
face, would almost have made me think
that inadvertently I had struck a right
chord, had not the supercilious smile with
which she repeated the word ‘effect’
denied the expression of her countenance.</p>

<p>‘I thought it could not be the case,’ I
said apologetically; ‘but you are really
looking so ill, Lionne. Will you not come
for a ride this evening?’</p>

<p>No; she declined to ride or to walk;
she only desired to remain by Janie’s side
and minister to her comfort. So be it,
then. I suppose it is natural she should
prefer her cousin’s company to mine,
though I am not aware that I have done
anything lately to make her shrink from
me as she appears to do.</p>

<p><i>August 4th.</i>—The ghost has appeared
again—or rather Janie imagines she has
seen it, which is just as hurtful to her
health and spirits. She had seemed so
merry all to-day, and so far removed from
the fanciful fears engendered by the natives’
stupid story, that after she and her cousin
had retired to rest I took my cigar up to
the roof of the house, as the heat has been
most oppressive lately, and I longed for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
breath of fresh air. Our house (like most
others in Mushin-Bunda) is built with a
flat roof, surrounded by a high parapet,
which roof is reached from the verandah
by a flight of steps so much resembling a
ladder, that it is not often I can persuade
the ladies to mount it. But, for my own
part, I am constantly in the habit of taking
my book and pipe (not to say my glass of
brandy-and-water) to this elevated retreat,
and, when there, thinking on anything or
nothing, as the humour may take me. To-night
my thoughts were not very cheerful
ones; for, without any especial reason, I
felt what is technically termed ‘dummy.’</p>

<p>Perhaps it is the excessive heat, perhaps
the continued weakness of Janie, but somehow
life has not appeared quite so sunny
to me lately as it used to do. I feel so
weary by the time the day is at an end,
and so dissatisfied with the manner in
which I have spent it, and I seem to rise
each morning with some undefined hope
which is never realised. I suppose it is
the monotonous life we lead which breeds
discontented thoughts; we so seldom
encounter anything to draw us out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
ourselves and our own concerns. And
Margaret Anstruther’s disinclination to
society has increased this disadvantage;
for we three—Janie and she and I—have
been thrown completely on each other for
company during the last two months.
And yet they have not passed unpleasantly.
It is strange that I, who so
much dreaded this interruption to the
quiet life which I led with my wife, should
be able to write those words and mean
them.</p>

<p>Yet I do mean them—though, at the
same time, I cannot believe that the
interruption has made me any happier,
for I don’t think I ever felt so restless and
unsettled as I do at present. I keep on
fancying that something is going to happen
to me; and start to remember that there
is nothing at all the matter, and that if I
have a cause for dissatisfaction, it must
rest with myself. It <i>must</i> be Janie’s illness
that affects me in this manner; it is
so unnatural to see the poor little woman
always lying on the sofa, instead of running
about with her cousin and myself.</p>

<p>I had been dreaming somewhat after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
this fashion on the roof of the house to-night,
for how long or how short a time I
should have been quite unable to say,
when I was startled from my reverie by
hearing a most piercing scream in Janie’s
voice and proceeding from Janie’s bedroom,
which sounded so shrill and alarming,
as it rung through the still night air,
that, though I rose at once to my feet, I
felt for the first moment so paralysed with
fear, that it was not until the cry had been
repeated that I ran down to her assistance.
I found her in a half-fainting state on the
sill of the bedroom window, which was
wide open; but my appearance changed
her condition to one of hysterical weeping,
which, whilst it was more painful to witness,
greatly relieved her. Meanwhile the
native servants, lying about the verandah
on their mats, were slumbering as heavily
as is their nature, and would not have
awakened of themselves had the cry been
twice as piercing, the alarm twice as
great.</p>

<p>‘My darling!’ I exclaimed, as I took
the shivering form of my wife (shivering
with fear, not cold) into my arms and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
pressed it to me, ‘what can have startled
you? Have you been dreaming?’</p>

<p>‘Dreaming!’ she repeated in a faint
whisper. ‘Oh no, Robert, I was not dreaming;
I was wide awake, and it passed
close to me.’</p>

<p>‘<i>It</i>—<i>it</i>—what do you mean, Janie?’
though I had guessed at once her fancy.</p>

<p>‘The ghost, Robert!—the dreadful ghost!
Ah’ (with another convulsive shudder),
‘I shall never, never forget the sight!’</p>

<p>‘<i>The ghost!</i> my dear girl, you have
really been dreaming. Where do you
fancy you saw it?—in this room?’ for I
had entered the room by the window by
this time, and still sat on the sill supporting
my wife in my arms.</p>

<p>‘I did not <i>fancy</i>,’ she replied, with an
earnestness which proved that she thought
she was right; ‘it passed so close to me,
Robert, that I could have touched it with
my finger. Ah, why did we ever come to
this fearful place!’</p>

<p>I lifted her up and placed her on her
bed again, and then, without releasing my
hold of her trembling fingers, I sat down
beside her and entreated her to tell me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
all. ‘Let me hear how you saw the ghost,
and where, Janie; and perhaps I may be
able to account for the apparent mystery.
And first, why did you leave your bed at
all? What waked you? You were so
fast asleep when I left you.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what waked me,’ she said
nervously; ‘perhaps the heat, for I felt so
restless that I could not sleep, and after a
good deal of tossing about, I got up and
walked to the window to cool myself, and
see if you were in the compound anywhere.
I was not thinking of the ghost, Robert,
indeed I was not; but directly I reached
the window I saw it—ah, just as they told
me, wandering about the graves!’</p>

<p>‘Janie dear, indeed you must be mistaken;
it was the moonlight shining on
the white lining of the silver bamboos,
or—’</p>

<p>‘Robert!’ she exclaimed, starting up
in bed as she clutched me by my arm, ‘I
tell you I <i>saw it</i>. It was no fancy, but a
tall woman dressed all in white walking in
and out of the graves.’</p>

<p>‘You are sure it was a woman?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes; oh yes; because, when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
screamed, it turned round and came close
by this window, and it had long hair
hanging right down its back. Oh, Robert,
I thought I should have died!’</p>

<p>‘My poor girl,’ I answered, as I forced
her to lie down again, ‘I am not going to
have you frightened in this abominable
manner. This is some trick on the part of
the natives; to what end I cannot imagine,
but they shall pay dearly for their little
game. Where did this woman go after
she had passed the window?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I can’t tell, Robert; I don’t know;
but I think it vanished round the house.’</p>

<p>‘Well then, if you will let me leave you,
Janie (I will call the ayah to come and sit
by your bedside), I will just look round
the compound, and see if I can find any
one loitering about.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t go after it, Robert; pray
don’t go after it; it might hurt you.’</p>

<p>But I could not wait to silence any more
of Janie’s fears; had I stayed to reason
them all away, I should have been kept
prisoner till morning. I roused the ayah,
bid her stay with her mistress till I returned,
selected a thick stick from my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
whip-stand, and proceeded on my voyage
of discovery. As I did so, I glanced at
my watch, and discovered to my amazement
that it was past one.</p>

<p>What a time I must have been dreaming
on the housetop!</p>

<p>I searched the compound and all the
accessible portions of the house thoroughly,
but I found and saw nothing. I wakened
all the slumbering occupants of the ‘godowns,’
to see if they had any strangers
amongst them, but only my own domestics
came yawningly to be inspected, and
certainly not one of them answers to the
description of the supposed ghost. As I
returned, I rapped at the closed venetians
of Miss Anstruther’s bedroom, and, to my
astonishment, her voice replied to me
immediately.</p>

<p>‘What! are you awake, Margaret?’ I demanded.
‘Was it the noise disturbed you?’</p>

<p>‘What noise?’ she asked, as she came
near to the venetians.</p>

<p>‘Janie’s scream. She fancies that she
saw the ghost (which I hoped she had
almost forgotten), and that it passed close
under her windows.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>‘Poor child!’ in a voice of compassion.
‘No, I did not hear, or I should have
gone to her; but I have not been long
awake;’ which, indeed, her voice seemed
to testify.</p>

<p>‘Why are you out of your bed?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot sleep; it is so hot,’ she answered
with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>‘And you have seen nothing?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly not; and have been sitting
at the window till within a minute ago.
I have only just closed the venetians
because the moon is so bright. It must be
all Janie’s fancy.’</p>

<p>‘Of course it is her fancy that she has
seen a ghost,’ I answered; ‘but I am not
so sure about her having seen nothing at
all. However, I shall find out more about
it to-morrow; meanwhile I must not keep
you up any longer. Good-night.’</p>

<p>‘Shall I go to Janie?’ she asked in the
same sleepy tone she had employed
before.</p>

<p>‘No, thank you; I am going to her
myself.’ And with that I passed on to
resume my guardianship over poor Janie
and her terrors. But I am determined to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
follow up this mystery until I am enabled
to dispel it; for which reason I shall
watch, night after night, for the appearance
of the person who dares to act
‘ghost’ in my compound until I see him;
for which reason also I shall keep my
watching a secret even from Janie and
Margaret.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I pooh-pooh the subject to
my wife, who easily takes her cue from
me, and will laugh at her own alarm by
this time to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>—She must rest with closed venetians
until this mystery is unravelled;
and I will steal out of bed after she is fast
asleep, and spend my nights upon the
housetop, which commands a view of every
part of the compound. And if I catch the
ghost, woe betide his bones; for if I don’t
make them rattle, it’s a pity!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thinking over matters, it
seems strange to me that Margaret
Anstruther, sitting at her window, should
not have heard the scream which reached
me so easily upon the roof; or that, at all
events, the conversation which subsequently
I held with my wife should not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
have been patent to her, as her room is
next to ours. However, she appeared half
asleep, even whilst she spoke to me; for
her voice was low and dreamy, and I could
hardly catch her words. I wonder what
prevents the girl sleeping! The same
mania seems to have fallen upon all of us;
for I don’t feel myself as though I should
close my eyes to-night, and every now and
then, as I steal a glance from my writing-table
to the bed, I see Janie’s blue orbs
wide open, and watching for the moment
when I shall rejoin her. So I lay down
my pen, and go to afford her the protection
of my presence.</p>

<p><i>August 6th.</i>—I spend my nights now
like a sparrow, on the housetop, so am
obliged to write my diary in the daytime.
I watched from eleven last night to four
this morning; but I saw nothing. The
air was so jolly and soft, that I had great
difficulty in keeping myself awake; but
with tobacco I managed to do it. Janie
wondered that I was so sleepy after parade
this morning, and accused me of growing
abominably lazy and old. She has almost
recovered her fright again, I am happy to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
say. Miss Anstruther, on the contrary,
looks worn and ill. I don’t think this
climate can agree with her. I wish she
would consent to see the doctor who attends
Janie.</p>

<p><i>August 7th.</i>—Was on the roof again all
last night. If, under the pursuit of knowledge,
it were only allowable for me to fall
asleep, it would be much pleasanter than
remaining downstairs. Towards three
o’clock I thought I had caught the ghost;
for I distinctly saw a ‘tall figure, dressed
all in white,’ hovering about the graves;
but it proved to be only an early milkman,
going to recover his cows from their jungle
pasture-ground, who thought to make a
short-cut by passing through our compound.
This was provoking, after I had
taken the trouble to rush down after him,
stick in hand, fully prepared to administer
a wholesome castigation. But this fact
tends still more to confirm me in my belief
that what Janie saw was a native wandering
about in the moonlight after his own
business.</p>

<p>All domestic servants, and a good many
other classes, habitually wear white clothing;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
and nothing would be easier, when
the imagination is in a heated and unnatural
condition, than for one to mistake their appearance
for that of a ghost. However,
I shall not yet give up my search for the
delinquent.</p>

<p><i>August 9th.</i>—I have now watched four
nights without seeing anything, and I am
beginning to get rather tired of the joke.
If the ghost doesn’t soon make his or her
appearance, I shall resume my lawful place
of rest, and wait patiently until it sees fit
to call upon me.</p>

<p><i>August 10th.</i>—At last I have seen the
so-called phantom; and had it been a lost
spirit sent from the nethermost hell to inform
me of my future fate, my hand could
hardly shake more than it does now, in
recalling the recollection. But not for the
reason which made its appearance one of
terror to the native servants and to my
poor Janie.</p>

<p>My terror, my horror, and my shrinking
arise from a totally different cause, and
make me wonder, as I write, that I should
have heard what I heard last night, and
live to repeat it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>I wish I had not lived; I wish that I
were dead!</p>

<p>I was on the roof, as usual, very tired,
rather dispirited, and more than half-disposed
to throw up the whole affair, and go
downstairs to bed. Where was the use, I
argued with myself, of watching night after
night in that fashion for a ghost which
never came? I was convinced that I was
troubling myself for a mere illusion—that
the phantom had never existed, except in
Janie’s imagination, or that if a trick had
really been played upon my wife by some
of the servants, the rascals had discovered
that I was watching for them, and were
too wide awake to repeat it until I should
have given up pursuit. And then with my
eyes always fixed upon that part of the
compound where the old Dutch graves are
thickest, I lit a cigar, and watching the
thin wreath of smoke which curled from it
into the air, sighed to think how transitory
all happiness is in this world, and how
seldom one’s earthly wishes, even when
realised, fulfil the promise of their attainment;
until I sufficiently forgot myself,
and the purpose of my being on the housetop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
in the middle of the night, to permit
the soothing influence of tobacco, added to
a soft light breeze, which fanned me as
delicately as though I had been a sleeping
infant to lull me off into a doze. How
long I slept I can hardly tell; but I know
that I woke with a start and a shiver, and
that the first thing I did was to rub my
eyes, and quickly turn them in the direction
of the tombstones and the graves.
What was that which I saw wandering up
and down that plot of ground, just as I
had been told it was wont to do? Was it
hallucination or reality? Had the impression
with which I fell to sleep remained
upon the retina of my eye to delude my
waking fancy? or was that which I gazed
upon a thing of flesh and blood? I rubbed
my eyes again, and shook myself, to
be assured that I was quite awake; and
then I advanced to the parapet and leant
well over it.</p>

<p>Yes, it was no mistake. A female figure
(or a figure dressed up so as to look like a
female), clothed in white, with long dark
hair streaming down her back, was feeling
her way, rather than wandering up and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
down, between the rows of graves, and,
with her hands stretched out before her,
seemed to be muttering or murmuring to
herself. I gave myself but time to be
assured that I <i>did</i> see it—that it <i>was</i> there;
and then I grasped my stick and loaded
pistol, and prepared to descend and encounter
it.</p>

<p>‘Take heed, my fine fellow,’ I said to
myself, as I carefully picked my way down
the flight of steps which led to the verandah;
‘don’t insult me, or attempt to
frighten me, as you value the brains in
your head, or a whole bone in your body.
I can bear as much as most men when I
am put to the test; but I won’t have my
wife frightened out of her wits for the
lives of all the niggers in the world.’</p>

<p>I slunk beneath the shadows cast by the
verandah, past the places where my servants
lay asleep to that side of the house
where are situated the bedrooms of my
wife and Miss Anstruther, and was glad
to see that the venetians of both windows
were closed, so that I trusted no alarm
might reach their ears.</p>

<p>And now, though I was close upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
the figure seemed to take no notice of my
presence, but still walked cautiously up
and down between the rows of graves,
whilst it kept up a sort of moaning to
itself. It looked so strange and unearthly
as it thus wandered beneath the moonlight,
that I felt myself shiver as I gazed
at it, and yet my belief in the whole
business turning out a trick was strong
as ever.</p>

<p>So, after a pause, just sufficient to
permit the figure to get as far as possible
away from the vicinity of my wife’s bedroom
windows, I sprang after it; and just
as it had turned again towards the house,
we met face to face. What was my surprise,
my consternation, in the ghost which
had caused us such trouble and vexation
to encounter—Margaret Anstruther! Yet
there she was, no clothing on but her light
night-dress; with her unbound tresses
streaming over her shoulders, and her
bare feet pressing the turf as though it
pained them.</p>

<p>‘Good God!’ I exclaimed, as I staggered
back at the sight of this earthly
apparition, far more alarming to me than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
if I had seen twenty ghosts; ‘Margaret—Lionne—what
are you doing here?’</p>

<p>At the sound of my voice she halted,
and turned her head slightly to one side,
as though to listen; and then by the
moonlight I perceived to my horror that
her eyes were lifeless although open, and
that she was walking in her sleep. I had
never encountered such a sight before, and
for a moment I knew not what to do.</p>

<p>‘Was that Robert?’ she murmured,
presently, in a low, husky voice utterly
unlike her own, and as though she were
addressing herself, or nobody.</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is I,’ I answered, trying to
control my agitation and my tones. ‘Margaret,
why are you here? why have you
left your bed?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Robert, Robert!’ she exclaimed,
with an expression of anguish which I
shall never forget, ‘save me, save me!’</p>

<p>‘From what am I to save you, Lionne?’</p>

<p>‘From yourself—from yourself, and from
me—from my weakness and my folly. Oh,
don’t let me fall! don’t let me fall!’</p>

<p>Although she still spoke dreamily, the
sightless orbs which she had turned upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
me were contracted with pain, and I saw
that her whole frame was trembling, I
ventured to go close to her, and gently
take her hand.</p>

<p>‘You shall not fall, dear Lionne,’ I
whispered to her; ‘trust to me. I will
lead you the right way.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Dear Lionne!</i>’ she repeated to herself,
‘<i>dear Lionne!</i> he says to me, <i>dear Lionne!</i>’</p>

<p>What was that quick fear which seized
me as I listened to her unconscious words?
What that trembling which assailed my
limbs, and rendered me incapable of moving
either backwards or forwards? The
fear and trembling fell so suddenly upon
me, that I had hardly time to realise their
presence, until they had resolved themselves
into a knowledge, fearful as a
thunderbolt from heaven, but certain as
that I live—or I must die!</p>

<p>I love her—and she loves me! We
have destroyed each other’s happiness.</p>

<p>As this conviction smote me, I dropped
her cold fingers, and sinking down upon
the hillock beside which she stood, buried
my face in my hands.</p>

<p>Good heavens! how was it that I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
never anticipated this—never seen it coming—never
dreamt of such a contingency?—that
I had spent day after day in her
company; reading with her, singing with
her, riding with her, listening to her amusing
conversation, watching all her womanly
kindness to my wife (ah, my poor wife!),
contemplating her beauty from hour to
hour, and never once suspected that I
might grow to love her more than was
good or right? And she, the girl whose
advent I had dreaded, whose manners I
had so disliked, whose beauty was to me
no beauty at all!</p>

<p>Ah, Margaret, Margaret! you may have
your revenge now if you will, in the assurance
that never, never more shall the remembrance
of that fatal beauty be purged
from my existence.</p>

<p>All was now explained; her worn
looks and dispirited appearance; my
own restless and uneasy sensations;
the guilty feeling had been growing
in us, surely though unconsciously, for
many long days past, and needed but
some such accident as the present to
warm it into life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>Have I not reason to wish that I were
dead?</p>

<p>I did not sit upon the hillock long;
something was waiting to be done, and
that was not the time for thought. I could
not even stay to watch her as she again
commenced to pace beneath the moonlight,
with the evening breeze playing with her
flimsy raiment, and making it cling about
her graceful figure. I felt that she must
be coaxed to return into the house, and
that I was neither the right person nor in
a right state of mind to do it.</p>

<p>So I rose quickly, and explaining the
circumstances to Janie’s ayah (an old woman
with more sense than the generality
of her tribe), directed her how to speak
soothingly to the young lady, and persuade
her to return to the house, where she need
be none the wiser for the untimely stroll
which she had taken; and after a little
while I was relieved to see the white
hand in the grasp of the dark one, and
the two women, so unlike each other in
all outward appearance, pass into the house
together.</p>

<p>So now it is all over; and the grey dawn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
is here; and as it was not worth while for
me to turn in before going to parade, I sit
down to transcribe the particulars of this
adventure before I forget it.</p>

<p>Shall I ever forget it?</p>

<p>I am aware that henceforward, and before
the world, I must play a part; but it
is useless to dissemble with my own heart.
This night has revealed to me what I had
rather have died than hear, but the truth
will make itself known.</p>

<p>I love her with my whole heart—passionately,
fervently, devotedly, as I have
never loved before. What is to come of
it? What is to become of her, of me, of
Janie? Are we all to be sacrificed?</p>

<p>As I write, there come into my mind
these sentences: one which fell from her
mouth (sweet mouth, that shall never be
mine!), and one which proceeded from my
own:</p>

<p>‘We who are strong should shield
them;’ and, ‘You shall not fall, trust to me—I
will lead you the right way.’</p>

<p>No, dear Janie, poor innocent child!
and you, my beloved one, do not fear. I
will shield both the weak and the strong;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
you shall not suffer for my imprudence or
my guilt.</p>

<p>Yet how to comfort, how to cure, how to
make up to <i>her</i> for the misery I have entailed
on her dear head? Oh, my God!
the task will be a hard one!</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><i>August 11th</i>.—I returned from
parade this morning tired, feverish,
and with a weight upon my
conscience as though I had committed
an unpardonable crime. I felt as if
I dared not face my injured wife, still less
the woman who has usurped her place in
my affections, or rather who holds the place
in which the other should have reigned.</p>

<p>Yet I was not only obliged to encounter
both of them, but to go through all the
formalities of daily life, without which
perhaps the trial would have proved too
much for my endurance.</p>

<p>Janie was the first; for since her illness
she has not risen to breakfast, and I have
been in the habit of carrying in her tray
for her. It was with a shaking hand that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
I lifted it to-day; and the poor child
noticed the difference in my demeanour,
and asked me tenderly if I were ill or
tired. I had not quite made up my mind,
before that, whether I should inform Janie
of her cousin’s propensity for somnambulism
or not; but as I met the trusting
glance of her blue eyes, I resolved to do
so, not only because it was a thing which
might occur again and frighten her as
before, but also that by confiding even so
far in my wife, I seemed voluntarily to
place a wider barrier between Lionne and
myself. Therefore I sat down on the bed,
and first binding her to secrecy, I related
to her how I had spent my late nights
upon the roof of the house, and by that
means arrived at a solution of the mystery
which had alarmed the native servants and
herself.</p>

<p>‘Didn’t I tell you that your ghost would
prove to be nothing?’ I said, trying to
speak gaily, in conclusion.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Robert dear,’ was her reply, ‘do
you call poor Lionne walking in her sleep
nothing? I think it is horrible—almost
as bad as a real ghost; and if I had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
you, I couldn’t have gone near her for
worlds. I should have died of fright first.’</p>

<p>‘But, Janie, you see that I am not a
silly little girl, ready to believe every idle
tale which is repeated to her. And you
must show yourself to be a wise woman
on this occasion, and be very careful that
the story does not reach your cousin’s ears,
as the knowledge is likely to make her
worse instead of better. I shall give the
ayah orders to hold her tongue, and sleep
outside the door in future, so that Miss
Anstruther may not wander about again
unobserved.’</p>

<p>‘And I mustn’t tell Lionne, then, that
you caught her?’ said Janie, in a voice of
disappointment.</p>

<p>‘Certainly not,’ I replied, decidedly;
and I rose to leave her, only half-satisfied
that my wishes would be respected. Janie
would not disobey me knowingly for the
world—she has never attempted such a
thing; but her little tongue goes so fast,
that she is apt to part with a secret before
she knows that it has left her keeping.</p>

<p>When I returned to the breakfast-room,
Lionne was already there, pale indeed and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
rather silent, as she has been for several
weeks past, but showing no signs that she
was aware of our nocturnal meeting. But
as I took her hand in mine, I felt the blood
rush up to my temples, and my morning
greeting must have been nearly unintelligible
to her.</p>

<p>Why did I behave so foolishly? She
is in all respects the same woman whom
I met yesterday with an ordinary salutation—her
manner even has not altered
towards me; and yet the mere consciousness
that that of which I had been vaguely
dreaming is reality, was sufficient to make
me almost betray what I feel by the expression
of my features.</p>

<p>Is this my boasted strength?</p>

<p>We took a silent meal, and altogether
an unprofitable one. I had no appetite;
Lionne only trifled with the eatables upon
her plate; and I think we both felt relieved
when the ceremony was concluded.</p>

<p>I did not see her for the remainder of
the morning, for I made an excuse of
business, and took my tiffin at the mess.
When I returned home at five o’clock,
however, I found Janie earnestly persuading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
her cousin to take a ride on horseback.</p>

<p>‘Do make her go, Robert dear,’ she
exclaimed, as soon as I came upon the
scene of action. ‘She has not ridden for
weeks past, and she does look so pale. I
am sure it will be good for her; you know
it will, Robert,’ with violent winks and
blinks which were sufficient in themselves
to make the uninitiated stop to inquire
their reason.</p>

<p>‘I daresay it will,’ I answered, obliged
to say something. ‘Won’t you be persuaded?’
addressing Lionne.</p>

<p>She hesitated a little, but had no good
reason to advance for her hesitation; and
after a little more pressing on Janie’s part,
retired to put on her habit.</p>

<p>‘I am <i>so</i> glad that she is going,’ exclaimed
my poor little caged bird, clapping
her hands at her success. ‘Take great
care of her, Robert; she is so kind to me.’</p>

<p>‘I will take care of her, Janie,’ I answered,
earnestly, ‘and of you too. You
may trust me, my dear; at least I hope so.’</p>

<p>‘Of course you take care of <i>me</i>, sir,’ she
replied, with a pretty pretension of pouting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
‘because I am <i>your wife</i>; but I am not so
sure about my poor cousin.’</p>

<p>‘Be sure, then, Janie, if you can. I
shall try to do my duty by both of you.’</p>

<p>‘Who talked of duty?’ cried my wife,
shrugging her shoulders. ‘I never saw
any one grown so grave as you have,
Robert; you never seem now to be able to
take a joke.’</p>

<p>I defended myself from this accusation
on the plea of having found several grey
hairs in my moustache last week; and
before Janie had done laughing at the idea,
Miss Anstruther reappeared, and I lifted
her on her horse as though she were an
ordinary friend to me, and my hands did
not tremble under the burden of the creature
I loved best in the world.</p>

<p>We rode on in silence together for some
moments, and then I turned my horse’s
head towards the sandy plain which I have
before mentioned as lying between us and
the ocean, and told her that I was about to
take her down to the beach, that she might
derive a little benefit from the sea-breeze.</p>

<p>‘Colonel Anstruther will not think that
we have been taking sufficient care of you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Margaret, if we send you to him with
such pale cheeks as you have now. I
am afraid you find the hot weather very
trying.’</p>

<p>‘I never liked the hot weather, even in
England,’ she answered vaguely, whilst the
rich blood mounted to her cheek beneath
the scrutinising glance which I had turned
towards her.</p>

<p>Our beach at Mushin-Bunda is hardly to
be called a beach; for it possesses scarcely
any shingles, but is composed of hillocks
of loose sand which never stay in one place
two nights together, but are ever shifting
quarters, and are about as treacherous footing
for an animal as one could desire. We
passed over these carefully, however, and
then we found ourselves upon the lower
sands, which are daily washed by the sea,
and rendered firm and level. Here we
halted; for it was low tide, and the refreshing
salt breeze fanned our hot faces, whilst
the horses we rode stretched out their
necks, and dilated their nostrils as though
to drink in as much of it as they could.</p>

<p>Still we were very silent, and under the
knowledge which had come to me the night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
before, the silence was even more oppressive
than usual.</p>

<p>‘This is delicious!’ I exclaimed at last;
‘worth coming farther than three miles to
enjoy. This will do you good, Margaret.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she sighed. ‘What would one
not give for a little of it occasionally during
these hot nights!’</p>

<p>‘You do not sleep well,’ I said, struck
by a sudden impulse.</p>

<p>She coloured as I addressed her; but
that is nothing new.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think I sleep badly,’ she replied,
after a pause. ‘I seldom lie awake for any
length of time, but—’</p>

<p>‘But when you rise in the morning, you
feel unrefreshed and tired.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know that?’ she demanded
quickly.</p>

<p>‘I guessed it, Margaret. I guess it from
your looks, your demeanour, your languor.
I know that you do not rest properly at
night, and that if you will not take seasonable
advice you will be ill.’</p>

<p>‘I am not ill,’ she answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>‘But you will be, which, under present
circumstances, would greatly distress Janie.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
Will you not consent to see a doctor—if
not for your own sake, for ours?’</p>

<p>I thought that physical care might in
some measure relieve the mental disturbance
under which she labours, or, at all
events, prevent a repetition of her somnambulistic
tendencies by which her secret
may, some day, be made patent to the
world. I never imagined she would guess
my meaning; but the next moment I saw
the mistake which I had made.</p>

<p>‘What have I been doing?’ she exclaimed,
turning round with a rapidity for
which I was totally unprepared. ‘What
have I been saying? Tell me at once,
Captain Norton; don’t keep me in suspense.’
And her dark eyes blazed upon
me as though they would search into my
very heart.</p>

<p>I trembled beneath the look, and was
dumb.</p>

<p>‘Why do you think I cannot rest—that
I shall be ill?’ she re-demanded almost
angrily; and then reading the truth, I suppose,
in my confused demeanour, she added
in a lower voice, a voice almost of terror,
<i>Have I been walking in my sleep?</i>’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>The ice was broken, then; and although
I still felt very uncomfortable in speaking
to her of the circumstance, I did not see
any other course open to me than to tell
her briefly of my endeavour to find out the
reason of my wife’s alarm, and the consequences
which had ensued from it.</p>

<p>‘I had not wished to mention this to
you,’ I said apologetically, ‘and only the
directness of your question should have
drawn it from me. However, as it is, I
daresay it is for the best; for though the
occurrence is a common one, it is as well
to guard against its repetition.’</p>

<p>‘<i>What did I say?</i>’ was the only reply
which she made to my concluding observation.</p>

<p>I had so slurred over the fact of her
speaking at all that I hoped it had escaped
her notice; but the tone in which she put
this question portended that she meant to
have it answered.</p>

<p>‘What did I say to you, Captain Norton?’
she repeated firmly.</p>

<p>I began to mumble something about the
words of sleep-walkers being always unintelligible,
but she brought me back to the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>‘You must have heard me; in fact, I
can see by your face that you <i>did</i> hear.
What was it that I said?’</p>

<p>‘I was so sleepy, Margaret,’ I commenced,
but I felt my voice shaking
audibly,—‘so sleepy, and altogether so
confused, and my memory not being of
the best, that I—I—really I—’</p>

<p>She gazed at me for a minute earnestly,
almost hungeringly—I could feel it, though
I did not see it—but I kept my eyes fixed
over the sea, and a dead silence ensued
between us. A dead silence, until it was
broken by the living sound of tears; and I
turned to see her dear head bent to her
saddle-bow, and her slight figure shaken
with her grief.</p>

<p>‘Margaret, dear Margaret!’ I exclaimed,
forgetting everything but herself, ‘it was
nothing—indeed it was nothing; a few
words spoken at random, of which no one
in his senses would think twice, or be so
presumptuous as to understand as the interpretation
of your true feelings towards him.’</p>

<p>But in my anxiety and ardour I had
blurted out far more than I intended.</p>

<p>‘Be silent!’ she cried, as she lifted an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
indignant burning face to mine—‘be silent,
Captain Norton! if you do not wish to insult
me, or make me hate myself and you.’
And with that she dashed her hand impetuously
across her eyes, and gathering
up her reins, turned her horse’s head away
from the sea-beach and began to canter
towards home. I followed her, of course;
but we did not exchange another word,
and she would not even condescend to
meet the imploring glance which, as I took
her from the saddle, I lifted towards her
face, mutely entreating for forgiveness.</p>

<p>She behaved much the same as usual
during the remainder of the evening; only
that I saw she studiously avoided coming
in contact with myself. What a fool I
was to say as much as I did! I, who
almost registered a vow this morning that
nothing should tear the secret from my
lips. And now I have betrayed her to
herself. I see she shuns me; I know she
fears me; I almost believe I have made
her hate me. Well, I have brought it on
myself, and I must bear it as best I may;
it only proves how little we know when
we think—as I did this morning—that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
world cannot hold a greater misfortune for
us than the one we then endure.</p>

<p>Oh, Lionne, Lionne! what is to be the
end of this?</p>

<p><i>August 12th.</i>—I was scarcely surprised
when Janie came to-day to tell me in a
broken voice that her cousin had just informed
her of her intention to leave Mushin-Bunda
as soon as possible, and that she
had already written to Mrs Grant to ask
if she could receive her at Madras until
her uncle’s wishes with respect to her movements
should be made known. I was not
surprised, because I felt convinced that,
after what had passed between us yesterday
afternoon, her proud spirit would forbid
her remaining under the same roof with
me, if any alternative were open to her;
at the same time I felt deeply hurt to
think that my imprudence should be the
means of driving her from the shelter of
it. Janie, on the other hand, innocent as
to the cause, had no reason to feel hurt,
except by the want of confidence reposed
in her; but she was wonderfully astonished,
and disposed to resent my not being so as
an additional grievance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>‘Why, you don’t seem in the least surprised
to hear it, Robert!’ she complained.
‘Has Margaret said anything about it to
you before?’</p>

<p>‘The subject has never been broached
between us; but Miss Anstruther has a
right, of course, to follow her own inclinations,
and we none to interfere with them.’</p>

<p>‘No; but what can be the <i>reason</i>?’</p>

<p>‘Did you not ask her, Janie?’</p>

<p>‘Of course; but she only says that she
does not feel so well here as she did at
Madras.’</p>

<p>‘I think that is quite sufficient to account
for her desiring a change. Strength soon
gives way in this country; and I don’t
think your cousin has been looking well or
strong lately. What we know of her sleep-walking
propensity is a proof of that.’</p>

<p>‘Then I mustn’t persuade her to stop
with us, Robert?’ continued Janie, pleadingly.</p>

<p>‘By no means, dear. Let her follow
the bent of her own wishes; it will be best
for all of us.’</p>

<p>‘But Uncle Henry will be so surprised;
and I am afraid he will be angry—and—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
I had so hoped she was going to stay
with me, Robert; and I feel so ill—and—and—so
nervous, and I can’t <i>bear</i> that
Margaret should go away.’ And here the
poor girl was quite overcome by the prospect
of her own weakness and her companion’s
departure, and burst into a flood
of childish tears.</p>

<p>I felt very sorry for Janie. She has so
thoroughly enjoyed the society of her
cousin, and she is not in a condition to be
vexed and thwarted with impunity. And
then again I thought of Lionne travelling
all the way back to Madras by herself, to
accept a home from strangers, with nothing
but her present unhappiness and her future
uncertainty to bear her company; and I
felt that neither of these should be the one
to suffer, and that if the circumstances
required a victim, it should be myself. I
did not particularly wish to leave my regiment,
nor my wife, nor any one else; but
if it is impossible for us to continue on the
same footing with one another, I felt that
I should be the one to go. So I did not
hesitate; but telling Janie to keep her
tears until she should be sure they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
required, went in search of Margaret Anstruther.</p>

<p>She was neither in the drawing-room
nor in the dining-room, but in a little antechamber
which it pleases my wife to call
her boudoir, but which is the dullest and
most unfrequented apartment in the house.
There I found her, lying on the sofa, shading
her eyes with her hand, but making no
attempt at work or reading.</p>

<p>‘Margaret, may I speak to you?’</p>

<p>I could not, because I had offended her,
go back to the more formal appellation of
‘Miss Anstruther;’ it seemed so much as
though we had quarrelled.</p>

<p>‘If it is of anything I should care to
hear,’ she said languidly.</p>

<p>‘It is of something to which I much
desire you should listen,’ I replied. ‘Janie
has just been telling me that you purpose
leaving us. Is that true?’</p>

<p>‘It is,’ she answered curtly, but not
unkindly.</p>

<p>‘I will not ask you for what reason,’ I
went on to say, ‘because your wishes are
your own, and shall be sacred; but if your
decision is not irrevocable, think twice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
before you inflict such a disappointment
on poor Janie. You know how weak and
ill she is at present.’</p>

<p>‘Captain Norton, I must go.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Must</i> you? If I leave the house myself—if
I leave the cantonment, and do
not return?’</p>

<p>‘You are not in earnest?’ she said,
raising her eyes to mine, too weary to be
called surprised.</p>

<p>‘I am. I have long intended going to
Haldabad on a shooting excursion, which
may detain me for two or three months.
Inadvertently almost I have delayed it,
your visit and Janie’s illness coming in the
way; but now I am ready to start at twelve
hours’ notice, if need be—indeed, I am
anxious to be gone.’</p>

<p>‘And what will Janie say to that, Captain
Norton?’ she demanded in a lowered
voice.</p>

<p>‘At this moment I believe that my absence
will affect Janie less than your
departure would do. She is very much
attached to you, and she feels the comfort
of a woman’s presence. Added to which,
Margaret, I am in a great measure responsible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
to your uncle for your proceedings,
and I shall not feel easy if you leave my
house for a stranger’s without previously
asking his consent. He will imagine I
have proved unfaithful to my trust. Do
you wish others to think as badly of me as
I do of myself?’</p>

<p>As I uttered these words I dropped my
voice almost to a whisper, but she heard
them plainly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, let me go! let me go!’ she exclaimed
wildly. ‘It will be better, far
better, for all of us. I cannot, indeed I
cannot, remain here; the air of this place
stifles me.’</p>

<p>‘I have made you despise me,’ I said
despondently.</p>

<p>‘No; oh no!’ and her dark eyes were
fixed upon me for a moment with an expression
which I would have kept in them
for ever; ‘but—you <i>know</i>, Captain Norton,
that it is best—that, in fact, we <i>must part</i>.’</p>

<p>‘I do know it,’ I replied; ‘and therefore
I am going. By this time to-morrow
I hope to have made all necessary
preparations, and to be ready for a start.
Meanwhile you will stay here—I know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
you will, because I ask you—to comfort
and look after Janie until you receive your
uncle’s consent to go to Madras. And
when it arrives, and you have left Mushin-Bunda,
I will return to it.’</p>

<p>‘And we shall never, never meet again!’
she said, in a voice so broken as to be
almost inarticulate.</p>

<p>I dared not answer her; had I spoken,
I must have poured out all my heart.</p>

<p>‘You have consented?’ were my next
words.</p>

<p>‘Yes, since you think it best; only I
am sorry to be the means of driving you
from home.’</p>

<p>‘If you are—though you have no need
to be—will you give me one recompense,
Margaret?’</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes inquiringly; speech
seemed almost lost to her.</p>

<p>‘Say you forgive me for what I told you
yesterday. I have sorely reproached myself
since.’</p>

<p>She stretched out her hand, and met
mine in a grasp which, though firm, was
cold as that of death.</p>

<p>‘Then we part friends?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>It was again myself who spoke; she
nodded her head in acquiescence, and I
felt my prudence evaporating, and rushed
from the apartment.</p>

<p>Written down, this interview seems
nothing; but to those who feel as we do,
the misery of years may be compressed
into an hour; and that small room, for
both of us, was worse than a torture-chamber.</p>

<p>I have scarcely seen her since, except at
meals; but, as I anticipated, my wife was
so delighted to learn that she should retain
her cousin’s company, that she thought
next to nothing of my proposed shooting
excursion, except to beg that I would take
care of myself, and to wonder how I could
like going after those ‘horrid bears’ and
‘awful tigers.’ Indeed, on the whole, I
half suspect the little woman is rather
glad to get rid of me, and pleased at the
idea of having Margaret all to herself for
a few weeks; for she has occasionally displayed
the faintest touch of jealousy when
I have broken up their <i>tête-à-tête</i> conferences.
So I have sent them word down
to the Fort to lay my ‘dawk’ for me, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
I shall start as soon as to-morrow’s sun
goes down.</p>

<p>I almost think we shall have a storm
first, which would pleasantly clear the air;
for the sky has been indigo-colour all to-day,
and there is a strange heaviness over
everything as I write.</p>

<p>I have been packing my portmanteau
and cleaning my weapons, until I have
fairly tired myself out; but were I to stop
to think, I could never summon courage
enough to go. The household is asleep,
and has been for hours; and I am sadly
in want of rest; for I can hardly keep my
eyes open or guide my pen upon the paper—and
yet I feel as though I should never
sleep again.</p>

<p>Bah! I must be mad or dreaming. I
am only starting on an ordinary shooting
excursion, and I feel as though I were
going to my grave.</p>

<p>This is folly—monomania; I shall be
thankful when the hour comes for me to
leave.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Madras, October 20th.</i>—It is more than
two months since I transcribed a line in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
this written record of my inmost thoughts—more
than two months since that awful,
horrible, and most unexpected catastrophe
occurred, which I cannot now recall without
a shudder, and which, for a time,
seemed as if it must obliterate my reason
or my life. But I am spared (though I
cannot yet say, thank God that it is so);
and were it not that my soul seems to die
within me, and my energy to languish for
want of some one or thing to which I may
confide my sorrow, I should not have the
courage even now to write the story down.
But I must speak, even though it be but to
a silent confidant, for my spirit fails for
lack of sympathy; and therefore I draw
out my old diary, and having read (shall I
be ashamed to say with tears?) what I have
written in these foregoing pages, proceed
to bring the tale to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Let me try to collect my scattered
thoughts, so apt to wander when I approach
this miserable subject, and carry
them back to the eventful moment when I
last left off—to the night of the 12th of
August.</p>

<p>I had sat up, packing my wardrobe and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
writing my diary, until I had fairly tired
myself out, and then, having put away my
book and writing materials into the table-drawer,
I locked it, and lighting a cigar,
sat down to think; of what, and in what
strain, I and these pages, to my misery,
best know.</p>

<p>I had no intention of permitting myself
to fall asleep; but it is my custom to smoke
just before retiring to bed, and I should
have anticipated a broken rest without the
indulgence. At the same time my fatigue
was greater than I thought, and after a
little while drowsiness came over me, and
before I knew that sleep was coming, I
was in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>And such a land! Thank heaven, for
those who are not destined in this world to
know substantial happiness, that dreams
remain to them.</p>

<p>I dreamt that I was with Margaret again
on the sea-shore; not riding, but wandering
hand-in-hand; not speaking coldly or with
averted faces, but eyes to eyes, and heart
to heart. I dreamt that I was watching
the damask blush which mantled on her
cheek, and listening to the low, mellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
sound of her rich voice, and that mingled
with my own reply came the hoarse murmur
of the ocean as it swelled and surged upon
the shore.</p>

<p>I dreamt that we were one; one not in
the earthly acceptation of the word, but in
that fuller sense by which spirits are united
to each other, never more to part; and that
as we strolled upon the beach together we
knew that neither death nor injury could
sever us again. And amidst it all I was
listening to the hoarse murmur of the
waves, which rolled up to our very feet,
and broke away, but to return with an
energy louder and more imperative than
before. I dreamt that as I stood thus,
enfolding my new-found treasure in my
arms, I started to find that the sky
was overcast, and that the tide had
surrounded us, and was behind as well
as before, and threatening to overwhelm
my darling. I dreamt that in my fear
and solicitude I drew her backwards,
trembling for her safety, and that as I
whispered words of love and reassurance,
I woke—to dream no more.</p>

<p>I woke, at the bidding of a loud and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
terrified scream from the lips of my native
servants, and springing to my feet, became
first aware of a sensation of intense chillness,
and next, as my remaining senses
gradually returned to me, of a hoarse
murmur somewhere near me, which recalled
the memory of my dream.</p>

<p>The night was intensely dark; there
seemed to be neither moon nor stars, and
for one moment I stood, uncertain which
way to move, and waiting to hear if the
cry had only been my fancy, or would be
repeated. Too soon it came again, this
time louder, more terrified, more piercing
than before; and its burden words of fearful
import, too fearful to be at first believed.
‘Master! master!’ it said in Hindustani;
‘master, the sea is on us!’ And before I
could scarcely realise the meaning of the
words, the natives who slept in the verandah
had rushed into my presence, and were
immediately followed by a huge wave of
water, which, with the hollow roar to which
I had listened in my dreams, burst into the
unprotected sitting-rooms, and washed over
my feet.</p>

<p>‘Master!’ cried the natives, as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
clambered upon tables and chairs, ‘the sea
has burst its bounds; the sea is coming on
us; the whole cantonment will be under
water!’</p>

<p>‘Close the doors and windows!’ I exclaimed
loudly; but no one stirred, and I
attempted to set them the example of doing
as I said, but it was too late. I perceived
a dark volume of water stealing stealthily
upon us from all sides, and even as I
advanced towards the verandah, a huge
wave dashed against me, washing me to
the middle, knocking me backwards on the
drawing-room table, and carrying away a
chair as it retreated. At the same moment,
a scream from the women’s apartments told
me that the sea had reached that quarter;
and with no thought but for the safety of
those dear to me, I dashed without ceremony
into Miss Anstruther’s room. I
found her pale and trembling, but just
awakened, sitting on the side of her bed
with her bare feet in a river of sea water.</p>

<p>‘What <i>is</i> the matter?’ she gasped as I
entered.</p>

<p>‘The sea has overflowed the cantonment,’
I replied hastily, as I quickly lifted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
her in my arms; ‘but trust to <i>me</i>, Lionne,
and I will take you to a place of safety.’</p>

<p>She shuddered but made no resistance,
until I had carried her to the dining-room,
now half full of water, and was
preparing to wade with her through the
verandah, and place her on the roof of
the house.</p>

<p>‘But where is Janie?’ she exclaimed, as
she looked with horror on the advancing
mass of water; ‘oh, where is Janie?’</p>

<p>At her question I nearly dropped my
burden; for the moment I had entirely
forgotten my poor wife, whose screams
were patent from the adjoining room.</p>

<p>‘Go to her,’ said Lionne, as she struggled
from my embrace, and slid down into the
cold waves, against the violence of which
she could hardly support herself. ‘Go at
once! What were you thinking of? She
will drown, if you do not take care.’</p>

<p>‘I am doing as much as I can,’ I answered
hurriedly. ‘Let me place you in
safety first, and then I will return for her.
I cannot carry two at once.’</p>

<p>‘And you would leave her to the last?’
she said indignantly; ‘she, in whom two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
lives are wrapt in one! Oh, Robert! I
did not think it of you.’</p>

<p>‘But, my beloved—’ I commenced, in an
agony at her delay.</p>

<p>‘Go!’ she said authoritatively; and I
left her to her fate, and went.</p>

<p>I found my poor little wife wet through
and screaming for help; and lifting her in
my arms, I carried her, buffeting with the
water as I went, through the dining and
drawing-rooms to the outer verandah.</p>

<p>‘Hold fast—take the greatest care of
yourself,’ I exclaimed in an agony of fear,
as I battled past the white-clad figure
which was clinging to the door-posts. ‘I
will return, Lionne, as soon as ever I
can.’</p>

<p>‘I am not afraid; God will take care of
me,’ was the calm reply; and I strode
forwards into deeper and deeper water
with each step. When I reached the
verandah the struggle was severe, for there
the waves were highest and strongest; but
although much impeded by Janie’s terrified
clasp, I managed to wade with her to the
foot of the ladder, and as soon as I had
accomplished two or three steps of that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
the rest was easy. I toiled with my helpless
burden up to the roof, despair lending
strength to my limbs; and as soon as I
had reached it, I found myself in a goodly
company of natives, who, with a few unfortunate
exceptions, had managed to gain
the top of the house as soon as the flood
had surprised them. Having delivered
Janie to the care of the ayah, I rushed
down again to the assistance of Lionne,
my heart throbbing as though it would
burst with the fear that my efforts might
be made too late. The water was now
higher than ever in the verandah, and I
began to be afraid that I should have to
swim back again. I dashed on as vigorously
and quickly as I could towards the
door, to the lintels of which I had left her
clinging. She was not there!</p>

<p>The dark water was swaying and surging
through the deserted rooms; the furniture
was floating about in the most dire confusion;
trunks, portmanteaus, and other
trivial articles knocked up against me at
every turn before they drifted out to sea;
but my beloved I saw nowhere. In an
agony I called upon her name, making the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
walls resound with my voice, caring nothing
who heard or listened to me.</p>

<p>‘Lionne, Lionne! my dearest, my beloved!
where are you? Speak to me.’</p>

<p>But no voice answered mine, no moan
or groan reached my ears; and I waded
into the chamber which had been my
wife’s.</p>

<p>Ah, what was that?—that helpless mass
of white drapery clinging about delicately-moulded
limbs, which swayed about in one
corner, prevented by the wall—thank
gracious heaven!—from floating out to
sea with chairs and tables, but being
knocked against that cruel wall with every
motion of the waves, until no apparent life
was left in it.</p>

<p>I took her senseless body in my arms,
thankful even in that condition to have it
there; and lifting the dear white face above
the reach of the impetuous tide, laid my
cheek against her own, although I believed
that human warmth would never again
visit it. It was no time for words or even
thought. I pressed her to me as fondly as
though the waves had been our bridal bed;
and resenting the despair which urged me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
to let the cruel water carry us both away
together then and there, battled with it
once more, and bore my treasure to the
place of safety. But it was with feelings
such as no words of mine can describe, that
I laid her beauteous form, cold, dripping,
on the bare bricks with which the roof is
paved. I had already stripped myself of
coat and waistcoat for Janie; and there was
nothing on which to lay the senseless
body of my darling but the wet cloths
which the natives could contribute, and
an old piece of carpet which was kept up
there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hoarse flood continued
to roll and murmur below, becoming
deeper and deeper with each surge of the
mass of waters; and cries of distress were
heard from the surrounding houses; and
the articles of furniture which floated past
us began to be mingled with a vision of
dead faces turned sightlessly towards the
moon, now beginning to struggle out from
behind the canopy of dark clouds which
had hitherto concealed her. And still I
bent above the face which had become so
unutterably dear to me, and prayed heaven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
to let her know me once more, if but for a
moment’s time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile poor Janie, exhausted by the
fright she had undergone, and the grief
she felt at the condition of her cousin, had
fallen into a state which was half sleep and
half syncope, and lay reclining with her
head upon her ayah’s lap.</p>

<p>And brother officers shouted to me from
the roofs of neighbouring houses, asking if
we were all safe—all well; and I answered
that I hoped, I trusted so; and prayed
heaven again to let her know me once more
before she died.</p>

<p>And God granted me my prayer. Towards
morning she awoke to consciousness.
Just as the grey dawn commenced
to break, and that dreadful flood, which
continued for forty-eight hours to pervade
the devoted cantonment, began to show
symptoms of being at its height, she opened
her dark eyes and gazed at me.</p>

<p>‘Where am I?’ she said, faintly.</p>

<p>‘Here, dearest,’ I replied, all reserve
vanished in the face of death,—‘here in
my arms; in the arms of him who loves
you better than his life.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>‘It is not hard to die so,’ she whispered;
but as she spoke an expression of agony
passed over her countenance.</p>

<p>‘Are you in great pain, Lionne?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ she replied with effort.</p>

<p>‘Where, dearest? tell me.’</p>

<p>‘Everywhere—all over. I was knocked
down so often.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, my beloved! and I not there to
help you.’</p>

<p>‘You were doing your duty, Robert;
and it will soon be over now—all will be
over soon—all pain—<i>all</i>—’</p>

<p>‘Not mine,’ I murmured in an agony.
‘Lionne, tell me—but once before we part—say
that you love me!’</p>

<p>‘My legacy,’ she whispered, with a faint
smile. ‘<i>Yes</i>, Robert; with all my heart—as
my life, better than my life.’</p>

<p>‘O God, spare her!’ I cried aloud.</p>

<p>‘O God, take me!’ she said herself;
‘take me from misery and disappointment
to where there are no tears.’</p>

<p>‘And how am I to live without you?’
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>Her dark eyes met mine reproachfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>‘Janie—your child,’ she gasped. ‘I—I
could have been—nothing.’</p>

<p>‘You are all the world to me!’ I exclaimed,
passionately.</p>

<p>She lay quiet for a few moments, and
then she opened her eyes wide, and fixed
them upon mine.</p>

<p>‘<i>Promise</i>,’ she gasped—‘Janie—to love—to
love—to comfort—to—’</p>

<p>She fell back in my arms, and for a few
minutes I watched with inexpressible pain
the convulsive working of her beautiful
features.</p>

<p>‘Better—so much better—that I should
go,’ she whispered, after a long pause;
and as she said the words she went.</p>

<p>It was the corpse of Margaret Anstruther,
and of all my earthly happiness, that I laid
down upon the sodden rags and piece of
carpet.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I have no heart to write down the details
of what followed. For two days that cruel
flood pervaded Mushin-Bunda before it
showed symptoms of subsiding; and before
that time arrived, several hundred lives
(chiefly natives) had been sacrificed. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
lost nearly all our furniture, though several
pieces were left stranded in the compound
when the waters retired; amongst others,
the writing-table which held my diary.</p>

<p>But what avails it to speak of personal
loss at such a time as this? My poor wife,
from the combined effects of cold, fatigue,
and terror, had a very serious illness, from
which at one time I almost feared she
might not recover; and on her return to
health I brought her to Madras, from which
place I write. She is now herself again;
and I am in good health and tolerable
spirits; and—and Margaret sleeps alone
in a shady corner of the English burying-ground
at Mushin-Bunda. No, not alone!
God is my witness that my heart sleeps
with her!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Note added ten years later.</i></p>

<p>I have been looking over my old diaries
to-day, and burning most of them; but
something within me seems to forbid that
I should destroy these few pages which record
the history of my brief acquaintanceship
with Margaret Anstruther. They are
the only remembrance I have left of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>Ten years have waxed and waned since
the dark night she died; what have they
left me? A wife whom I love and in whom
I trust; who, I may safely say, I would
exchange for no woman living; who has
brought me children, loving and docile as
herself, and very dear to me; a happy
peaceful home (no longer in the East); a
moderate competence; and a name which I
trust no man holds lightly.</p>

<p>And to these many blessings I add contentment,
and wonder what more good on
this earth a mortal could expect.</p>

<p>On this earth none; but whilst I ponder,
I thank God that this earth is not the end
of all things.</p>

<p>There was a time when I used to think
and say that all my happiness lay buried
in the grave of Lionne; but I have lived
to learn and believe that at the Last Day
it shall rise again, with her to bloom, ten
thousand times renewed, in heaven!</p>

<p class="center">THE END.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It was at the close of a sultry
day in June, that the passenger
vessel, ‘Star of the North,’
coasted the island of Martinique
on her way to Barbadoes. The sea was
calm as a summer lake, and an ominous
stillness reigned in the surrounding atmosphere
that made the words of a song,
trolled out by a free, manly voice from the
forecastle, distinctly heard in every part of
the vessel,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Wherever you be, by land or sea,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Don’t believe it,’ grumbled an old seaman,
who was seated on a coil of rope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
mending a sail. ‘I wish I’d had the
ordering of my own life, any way. I’d
have soon seen if it was best for me to be
situated as I am at this here present!’</p>

<p>He was a fine old man, with rugged but
well-cut features and muscular limbs. He
had a clear blue eye, and silvery locks that
showed he had been a handsome fellow in
his day; but something or other had put
him out of love with life, and his habitual
mood was one of discontent. A passenger,
who was pacing the quarter-deck, with a
thoughtful countenance, turned at the old
sailor’s words and confronted the speaker.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you believe in a Providence
that overrules all our actions, Williams?’
he demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, Mr Egerton, I believe in
Providence fast enough; but when I see
want and misery and injustice on every
side of me, I cannot help thinking as our
actions might be ruled a little straighter
for us.’</p>

<p>‘We are all apt to think the same, but
that is because we cannot see the end
of the beginning. Perhaps, too, you have
never prayed that Providence might extend
its fostering care over you?’</p>

<p>‘You’re mistaken, sir. No man ever
prayed more than I used to do. I was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
reg’lar conwarted Christian at one time;
and a morial example, but ’twarn’t no
manner of use. No one never heard nor
answered my prayers, and so I left off
a saying ’em, and I don’t see as my
troubles are a bit the wuss for it, neither.
Everybody seems to get much of a muchness
in this world, let ’em wear out their
marrer bones or not.’</p>

<p>He re-applied himself to the patching of
his sail, and the young man who had
addressed him looked over the dark blue
waters and sighed. He, too, had prayed
for some weeks past that a certain blessing
on which he had set his heart might be
granted him, and his prayers had been
returned upon his hands, as it were, unanswered.
He was a very sad and disappointed
man that evening, but his faith
in Heaven was not one whit shaken by
the trouble that had overtaken him.
Even the clear, ringing laughter of Miss
Herbert, as she sat on the poop and
responded to the <i>badinage</i> and compliments
of the group of gentlemen by which she
was surrounded, although it made Egerton’s
brave heart quiver with pain, had
not the power to cause it to despair.</p>

<p>‘Williams,’ he said, after a pause, ‘you
are altogether wrong. Prayer may not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
be answered at once, nor in the manner
we anticipate, but it is always heard, and
what that song says is true,—“Whatever
<i>is</i>, is best.” It must be.’</p>

<p>But Williams still looked dubious.</p>

<p>‘It’s all very well for them, sir, as is rich
and young, and got all their life before
’em, to think so. I dare say everything
do seem best to them; but let ’em be
sick and sorry and old, and obliged to
work hard for their living, and I warrant
they’d sing to a different sort of tune.’</p>

<p>‘Are you sick, Williams?’</p>

<p>‘Pretty middlin’, sir. I’ve done a deal of
hard work in my time, and I has the rhoomatics
that bad in my hands sometimes
as makes every stitch I put a trouble to me.’</p>

<p>‘Are you sorry?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ve had my share of that lot,
Mr Egerton; but as I’ve told you already,
’twas nothin’ to nobody what I suffered
nor what I felt, and so I’ve larned to hold
my tongue upon the matter.’</p>

<p>Richard Egerton looked at the old
sailor’s rugged face, down which time or
trouble had made many a furrow, and his
heart went out to this fellow-creature, who
had sorrowed perhaps as much as he was
doing himself, and had no outward alleviation
for the world’s injustice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>‘Did you ever watch two people play a
game of chess, Williams?’ he asked,
presently.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean them little figures as
they move about on a black-and-white
board, same as we use for draughts, sir?’</p>

<p>‘I do.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes! I’ve watched the passengers
playing that game many a time.’</p>

<p>‘Didn’t it puzzle you at first to understand
why the players should sometimes allow
their men to be taken from them, or even
place them in positions of danger where they
could not possibly escape being captured?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir!’ cried old Williams, brightening
up with intelligence. ‘I remember
there was one gentleman that crossed with
us last year to Trinidad, and he used to
boast that there was no one on board could
beat him at that game. And no more
there was, and his play was always to let
the other sweep near half his men off the
board afore he’d begin in arnest at all.
Lord! I’ve stood and watched ’em when I
was off duty, many and many a time, and
been as near as possible a-crying out to
him to take care; but he had got the
game, sir, at his fingers’ end, and always
came off victor, whoever sat down with him.’</p>

<p>‘Just so. That gentleman’s plan must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
have seemed inexplicable to anyone who
was ignorant of the rules of chess, but
those who knew them and watched them
to the end, would have understood that he
allowed his knights and pawns to be
taken only, that he might preserve his
queen and his castle, and win the game
for them all. Do you follow me?’</p>

<p>‘I think I can, sir, though I don’t know
where the dickens you’re a leading me to.’</p>

<p>‘Only to this point—that you must try
and think in the same way of the dealings
of Providence with men. We cannot tell
why one of us is rich and the other poor;
why one has blessings in this life and the
other nothing but troubles. But God
does. We only see the effect; He knows
the cause. He is the player of the game,
Williams, and does not allow one piece to
be taken captive by the enemy, except
with a view to final victory.’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, that’s all very clever argumentation,
but it don’t convince <i>me</i>. It’s
sorry work listenin’ to reason for comfort.
He’s swept away all my pieces, one arter
another—there’s no question about that—and
left me alone in the world, and I can’t
see the mercy of it nor the justice either,’
replied the old man in a discontented
tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>‘But it is not only to the sick and the
old and the poor that He deals out His
judgments,’ continued Egerton sadly.
‘We all have our troubles, in whatever
position we may be placed.’</p>

<p>At this moment the man up on the forecastle
shouted again at the top of his voice,
‘Whatever is, is best.’</p>

<p>‘I wish that Ben’s tongue was a little
shorter,’ exclaimed Williams hastily. ‘He’s
always a bawlin’ out them cheerful songs,
as makes a feller feel twice as downhearted
as he did afore.’</p>

<p>‘’Twould be all the same to you, “Old
Contrairy,” whatever he sung,’ remarked
another sailor in passing; ‘for the song
ain’t written yet as would give <i>you</i> any
satisfaction to listen to.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I likes to hear sense, whatever it
be,’ shouted “Old Contrairy” after him.
‘Look at that bank of clouds, rolling up
from leeward. We shall have a squall
before long, as sure as I sits here. However,
I suppose that fool Ben would go on
shoutin’ “Whatever is, is best,” if the
“Star of the North” was split into fifty
pieces, and he was just goin’ under water
with his mouth choke full of weed.’</p>

<p>‘Heaven forbid!’ exclaimed Egerton, as
he turned away to seek his cabin. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
conversation with the old seaman had had
the effect of increasing his depression, and
he felt as if he could not trust himself to
argue with him any longer. He would
have much preferred on this sultry evening
to take up his usual quarters on the poop,
where the rest of the passengers were
assembled; but he had not the courage to
go there. So the poor young fellow left
the deck, and, entering his cabin threw
himself down upon the sofa, which served
him for a bedstead, and abandoned himself
to the luxury of grief. He was altogether
too young and too good-looking to feel so
utterly bereft of hope. His bright brown
curls covered a brow which was full of
intellect, and bore upon its broad expanse
the best sign of an honourable man—the
impress of frankness and truth. His deep
blue eyes, now so dull and troubled with
disappointment, were generally bright and
mirthful, and his athletic limbs, although
but the growth of four-and-twenty years,
gave promise of an unusual acquisition of
manly strength and power.</p>

<p>And Richard Egerton had other heritages
besides those of youth and beauty. He
was the possessor, as the old seaman had
intimated, of wealth and influence. He
had been adopted in his infancy by a rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
relation, who had lately died, leaving him the
whole of his fortune and his large estates
in Barbadoes, on the condition that he
assumed the name of Egerton, instead of
that which had been his by birth. But
what did all these advantages avail the
poor lad to-day?—this day which had
dawned so full of hope, and was now about
to set upon the heaviest heart he had ever
carried in his bosom. And pretty Amy
Herbert, whose laughter still reached his
ear at times, even where he lay, was the
cause of all this trouble. They were not
entirely new acquaintances. He had met
her in England some months before, and
had taken his passage to Barbadoes by the
“Star of the North” only because he heard
that she was going to travel in it to join
her father, who was a civilian of some
repute in Trinidad. He had admired her
from the first moment of their acquaintance,
and the weeks they had spent on board
had ripened his admiration into love, and
made him hope, as he had had every reason
to do, that she was not indifferent to himself.
He believed that his position as owner of
considerable property in the West Indies
would have ensured a favourable reception
at the hands of her father, and had approached
the subject of marriage with her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
if not with the certainty of being met halfway,
at least with a modest hope that she
could not think him presumptuous. And
Amy Herbert had refused his offer—point-blank
and without hesitation—unequivocally
and decidedly refused it. It had
fallen upon him as an unmitigated blow.
How lovely she had looked that morning
when he found her sitting in her basket-chair
in a corner of the poop, shading her
sweet, soft eyes from the glaring light with
a rose-lined parasol. How confidently he
had believed that he should see the long
lashes lowered over those beautiful eyes,
and the maiden flush of combined shyness
and pleasure mount to that delicate cheek,
as he poured forth his tale of love to her.</p>

<p>Others had watched the young couple
sitting so close together on the poop that
morning, and guessed what was going on.
Others had seen Richard Egerton bending
lower and lower over his pretty fellow-passenger,
and gazing into her eyes as
though he would read her very soul, as
he whispered his hopes to her. The poor
young fellow had been very modest over
it, but he had made so sure that Amy
Herbert’s looks and actions could not have
deceived him, that he had almost thanked
her beforehand for the answer he expected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
to receive. And she had listened to his
proposal with well-feigned surprise, and
rejected it with ill-advised haste. She had
thought in her silly, girlish inexperience
that it was more correct and womanly to
appear horrified at the first idea of marriage,
and she had been almost as despairing
as himself as she saw Richard Egerton
take her at her word and turn away without
a second appeal, to hide his wounded
pride below. She was deeply repenting
her abrupt dismissal of him as she flirted
on the poop with Captain Barrington, who
was returning from leave to join his regiment
in Barbadoes. But how was poor
Egerton to know that, as he cast himself
dejectedly upon his narrow berth and lay,
face downwards, with his eyes pressed upon
the pillow, lest the hot tears that scorched
them should overflow and betray his weakness?
The sound of her voice tortured
him. He believed that she must be in
earnest in showing a preference for Captain
Barrington, and he was not yet strong
enough to watch her fair face smiling on
another man. So he delivered himself
over to melancholy, and tried hard to
believe that he would not have things
other than they were.</p>

<p>‘Whatever is, is best,’ he kept on repeating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
inwardly. ‘It will not do for me
to preach a lesson to another man that I
am unable to apply to myself. Besides,
it is true. I know it to be so. My whole
existence has proved it hitherto.’</p>

<p>Yet the smiling, sunlit pastures and cane
fields, to which he was taking his way,
and which had seemed so beautiful in
prospect when he had hoped to secure fair
Amy Herbert to reign over them as mistress,
appeared to afford him but dull
anticipation now.</p>

<p>‘How shall I ever get through the
work?’ he thought, ‘and my heavy heart
and sluggish spirit will lay me open to the
worst influences of the country. But I
will not despair. My wants and my weakness
are not unknown, and a way will be
found for me even out of this “Slough of
Despond.”’</p>

<p>He was suddenly roused from his love-sick
reverie by the sound of a low moaning,
which seemed to pervade the surrounding
atmosphere. Starting up on his couch,
Egerton now perceived through the porthole
that the sky had become dark, and
the noise of the captain of the vessel
shouting his orders through a speaking-trumpet,
and the sailors rushing about to
execute them, made him aware that something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
was wrong. He was not the man
to keep out of the way of danger. Brave
as a lion and intrepid as an eagle, Richard
Egerton, from a boy, had ever been the
foremost in any emergency or danger.
Now, as the warning sounds reached his
ear, he rushed at once on deck. He
remembered ‘Old Contrairy’s’ prophecy of
a squall, and his first thoughts were for
the comfort and safety of Miss Herbert.
But as he issued from the passengers’
saloon a fearful sight awaited him. One
of those sudden hurricanes, for which the
West Indies are famous, and which will
sometimes swamp the stoutest vessel in
the course of a few seconds, had arisen,
and the whole ship’s company was in confusion.
As Egerton sprang upon deck he
could distinctly see what appeared to be
a black wall of water advancing steadily to
meet the unfortunate ‘Star of the North.’
With the exception of the noise consequent
on attempting to furl the sails in time to
receive the shock of the approaching storm,
there was but little tumult upon deck, for
everyone seemed paralysed with terror.</p>

<p>At the first alarm, Miss Herbert, with
the remainder of the passengers from the
poop, had attempted to go below, but,
having reached the quarter-deck, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
crouching at the foot of the companion-ladder,
too terrified by the violence of the
tornado to proceed further. As for Egerton,
he had to hold on fast to the bulwarks
to prevent himself being washed overboard.
His head was bare, and as he
stood there, with the wind blowing his
curls about in the wildest disorder, and his
handsome face knit with anxiety and pain,
Amy Herbert looked up and saw him, and
registered a vow, in the midst of her alarm,
that if they ever came safely out of that
fearful storm she would humble her pride
before him and confess that she had
been in the wrong. The moaning of the
tempest increased to a stunning roar, and
then the huge wall of water broke upon the
‘Star of the North’ with a violence to
which no thunder can bear comparison.</p>

<p>All hands were aghast, and the men
were dashed about the deck hither and
thither as the wind caught the vessel on
her broadside. The awful noise of the
hurricane rendered all communication by
speech impossible, but the captain, by setting
the example, stimulated his men to
cut away the masts in order to right the
ship, which had been thrown almost on
her beam-ends.</p>

<p>In a moment Egerton perceived the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
danger to which Amy Herbert would be
exposed by the fall of the crashing timber.
She was crouching in the most exposed
part of the quarter-deck, her lovely eyes
raised upwards, full of the wildest fear.</p>

<p>‘There! there! Go there!’ he exclaimed
frantically, though his voice had
no power to reach her, as he pointed to a
more sheltered position under the companion-ladder.
‘Get under there, for
Heaven’s sake!’</p>

<p>She saw the warning gesture of his
hand, the agony depicted in his face, and
understood the meaning of them, just as
the huge mast bowed itself towards the
sea. Egerton continued his efforts to
make her see the necessity of moving, and
she was just about to take advantage of
the hint, when Captain Barrington crawled
on all fours into the place himself. The
little man was not too brave by nature,
and fear had driven all thoughts of chivalry
out of his head. For the moment the girl
did not see who had forestalled her intention;
she only perceived that she had
lost her chance of safety, and waited the
event in trembling anxiety. Down came
the topmast with a crashing shock that
threatened to sink the vessel. Yet Amy
Herbert was sheltered from possible injury,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
for, with a mighty effort, Richard Egerton
had quitted his stronghold and flung his
body upon the deck before her. For one
moment he was conscious—happily conscious—that
she was safe, and he had
saved her; the next, he had fainted from
a blow on the head and the pain of a large
splinter of wood that had been broken from
the falling mast and driven with violence
into his arm. He did not hear the scream
with which Amy Herbert viewed the
accident, nor see the agonised face which
bent above his prostrate form. He heard,
and saw, and knew nothing, until he
opened his eyes in his own cabin and
perceived, with the dazed wonder of returning
consciousness, that the old sailor,
Williams, and the ship’s doctor, Mr French,
were bending over him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘You’ll do now,’ remarked the doctor as
he held a cordial to his lips.</p>

<p>‘Is she safe?’ was all Richard Egerton
said in reply, as he looked at his splintered
arm. They thought he meant the ‘Star
of the North.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, she’s safe enough now, sir,’
replied the old seaman; ‘but we’ve had an
awful time of it, and no mistake. We’ve
lost our top-gallant mast, and our spars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
and hen-coops have been washed overboard,
and one of the boats got adrift in
the squall, and the poor “Star” is stript of
half her toggery.’</p>

<p>‘But are any of the passengers injured?’</p>

<p>‘No one but yourself, sir; but two of
our best men went over with the mast, and
Ralph White has broke his leg, and there’ll
be a tidy little bill for some one to pay
when we gets into port again.’</p>

<p>‘And that reminds me, Williams, that
I must go and look after poor White,’ said
the doctor. ‘I think I may leave my
patient in your care now. All you have
got to do is to see that he lies there till I
come back again.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll look after the gentleman, doctor,
never you fear,’ replied the old seaman as
Mr French left the cabin.</p>

<p>‘It was an awful hurricane, Williams,’
remarked Egerton, with a sigh of remembrance,
as he turned uneasily upon his
pillow.</p>

<p>‘You may well say that, sir; and it’s
just a miracle as we’re still afloat.’</p>

<p>‘How little we thought, as we talked
together on deck an hour or two ago, that
death was so close at hand for some of us.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, indeed, and with that smiling,
burning, treacherous blue sky above us.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
You have seen some of the dangers now,
sir. I suppose you ain’t going, in the face
of this storm, to hold to Bill’s song, that
“Whatever is, is best.”’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I am, Williams,’ replied the young
man firmly.</p>

<p>‘What! with our tight little ship knocked
to pieces in this fashion, and your arm
broken in two places?’</p>

<p>‘Just so, Williams. Heaven sent both
the storm and the accident. They <i>must</i>
be for the best.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m blowed!’ exclaimed the old
sailor in sheer amazement. The announcement
seemed to have taken all the wind
out of his sails, and he sat staring at the
wounded man as if he had charge of a
lunatic.</p>

<p>‘How comes it that you are attending
on me?’ asked Egerton, as Williams
handed him a glass of water.</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, I seem to have took a fancy
to your way of talking; so when they
wanted some one here to help the doctor
with your arm I offered to come, that’s all.’</p>

<p>‘It was very good of you. You told
me this morning that you had had troubles,
and prayer had never availed to get you
out them. Do you mind telling me what
those troubles are?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<p>‘Not a bit, sir, if I sha’n’t tire you; but
it is a long story. I had a sweetheart
when I was a young chap—most young
chaps have, you know, sir—I daresay
you’ve had one yourself before now—and
I had a school-mate, too, by name—well!
we’ll call him Robert—and we both
loved the girl dearly; but he got her, sir,
and I had to go to the wall.’</p>

<p>‘That was very unlucky for you.’</p>

<p>‘Well, it was unfortunate, though he
courted her above-board, and all was fair
enough at the time. But the worst of it
was that he turned out a regular bad ’un,
and ill-treated his wife shamefully arter he’d
married her. When I came home from
sea, it used to make my blood reg’lar boil
to hear poor Lottie tell how he’d beaten
and kicked and starved her, for he’d taken
to drink, you see, sir, and all his love had
gone like a flash of lightning.’</p>

<p>‘Was he a sailor too?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, and once, when I come off a
long voyage to China and Australy, and
round home by San Francisco, I heard
that Lottie was a widder and in great
distress, without hardly a bit of money.
Well, I looked her up pretty sharp, as you
may guess, and I found it was all true.’</p>

<p>‘And then you married her.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>‘No, I didn’t sir. I’ve never been
married. I don’t deny I asked her, but
she wouldn’t have me, nor no one. She
said it was too late, and she was dyin’,
which sure enough she was. But she had
a child, sir—little Dickey—such a dear
little chap, with blue eyes—just like her
own—and pretty yeller curls; and when
she died she left him on my hands, and
lor’, how fond I was of that little creetur!
He took his poor mammy’s place in my
heart altogether.’</p>

<p>The old sailor stopped here, and drew
his hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>‘Did he die too, Williams?’ inquired
Egerton.</p>

<p>‘Not as I knows of, sir. He may be
dead or livin’. It’s all the same to me
now. <i>That</i> was the time I used to pray,
Mr Egerton, night and day, that the little
feller I was so proud on might grow up a
good man and a good son to me and a
comfort to my old age, and when I lost
him I chucked up religion altogether.’</p>

<p>‘How did you lose him?’</p>

<p>‘In the crudest of ways, sir. He had
grow’d up beside me five years, and I had
done everythink for him; and when he’d
put his two little arms round my neck and
kiss me, and look so like his poor mother—who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
was the only sweetheart I ever had,
Mr Egerton—I used to thank the Lord,
with tears in my eyes, for <i>His</i> goodness to
me. But it was all a delusion, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Tell me the end of it.’</p>

<p>‘The end of it was that, when my pretty
Dickey was a smart little feller of about
ten years old, I got him a place as ship-boy
aboard the ‘Lady Bird,’ and we sailed
for the Brazils together, as proud and ’appy
as the days was long. And I was a teachin’
the boy everythink, Mr Egerton, and he
was gettin’ that ’cute and handy—when, in
an evil moment, that man whom we all
thought dead and buried, turned up again
somewhere down by Rio Janeiro, and
claimed his boy of me.’</p>

<p>‘What! the father?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. Of course he had the right
to do it, and that’s what the skipper tried
to make me understand; but it broke my
heart entirely. He thought he’d make
money out of the lad’s wages, and so he
took him away from me, who was just like
a father to him; and his screams, as we
parted, have never left my ears since. And
when I heard afterwards that the brute ill-treated
Dickey, just as he’d done his poor
mammy, I nearly went mad. The men
calls me sulky, and “Old Contrairy,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
sich like names; but many’s the time when
they think me cross, I’m only dreaming
over that time ag’in and cursin’ them as
brought me to sich a pitch. I shall never
see my pretty Dickey ag’in, sir, till I meets
’im up above; and I shall owe Robert
Hudson a grudge to the day of my death
for robbin’ me of him in that there cruel
manner.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Who</i> did you say?’ cried Egerton,
starting up in his berth.</p>

<p>‘Please to lie down, sir? The doctor
will be arter me if I lets you knock about
in that manner. The name slipped out
unawares, for ’tain’t of no use raking it up
ag’in. It has nothin’ to do with my story.’</p>

<p>‘But, pray, tell it me again?’</p>

<p>‘It was Robert Hudson, sir.’</p>

<p>‘But Robert Hudson was the name of
<i>my</i> father!’</p>

<p>‘<i>Your</i> father, sir! But, beggin’ your
pardon, how can that be, when you’re
called Egerton?’</p>

<p>‘I know I am; but I took the name
from a relation who left me his money on
condition that I did so. My real name is
Richard Hudson, and I was brought up to
the sea and adopted by my mother’s cousin,
Henry Egerton, because my father treated
me so brutally. He was had up by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
police for thrashing me till I fainted, and
then the magistrates gave me over to the
guardianship of Mr Egerton——; and,
Williams, can it possibly be?’</p>

<p>‘Sir, sir! don’t keep me in suspense.
What was the maiden name of your
mother?’</p>

<p>‘Charlotte Erskine, and she was born
in Essex.’</p>

<p>‘At Pinfold?’</p>

<p>‘That is the place. My grandfather
had the “Peartree Farm” there, and she
is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. Mr
Egerton used often to take me to see her
grave.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, sir! this is very, very wonderful!
Is it possible you can be my little Dickey?’</p>

<p>‘It is quite true that I am the son of
Robert and Charlotte Hudson, and that if
I had not changed my name, we should
have recognised each other before now.
Do not think I have forgotten you, Williams?
I cannot remember the face of my
sailor friend; but I have never forgotten
all his kindness to me. But surely I used
to call you “Caleb” in those days, and
have always thought of you by that name
since.’</p>

<p>‘True, enough, sir, that’s me—Caleb
Williams, and I can hear your sweet little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
voice a-callin’ Caleb from the top of the
house to the bottom now; you was never
long out of my arms, Mr Egerton. Day
and night you was on this bosom, as you
may say, and my heart’s been as empty as
a dried gourd since I lost sight of you.
And so you’re my own boy—leastways,
what I used to call my own—and I’ve
been a nussin’ you again as I used to nurse
you in the olden times. Oh, bless the Lord
for all His mercies!’ cried the old seaman,
as he fairly broke down, and sobbed with
his face in his hands.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They talked for a long time over the
past; Richard Egerton being scarcely less
affected than old Williams, as, one by one,
little incidents and reminiscences came to
light to confirm their several identities,
and make him see still more clearly how
much he owed to the old man who sat
beside him.</p>

<p>‘And now, Caleb,’ he said, when the
evening shadows had deepened into dusk,
‘this will be your last voyage. I cannot
let you work any more. You know that I
have riches, and you must share them.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, sir, you are too good!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t call me “sir” again, please. Call
me Richard, Caleb, or “Dickey,” or anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
that pleases your fancy; but the man
who acted as a father to me when I had
worse than none, shall never address me
as though I were his superior. What was
it you prayed for me to become, Caleb, in
those days when I used to sit on your knee
with my little hands clasped about your
neck?’</p>

<p>‘A good man and a good son, my dear,
dear boy,’ quavered the old seaman.</p>

<p>‘Well, I will try, at all events, to fulfil
the last clause. My cousin Egerton, who
was a rich tradesman, has left me all his
property. I have land and houses in Barbadoes,
and I intend to settle there; at
least, for the next few years. You must
come and live with me. You will find
plenty of work on the estate to employ
your time, if you wish to work; and if you
wish to rest, you shall be idle. My father
has been dead in reality for many years
past, so that we shall be left alone and in
peace this time to end our days together.’</p>

<p>‘And there is no one else, my dear boy?’
inquired Williams anxiously.</p>

<p>‘How do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘You are not married, nor likely to be?’</p>

<p>‘I am not married, nor likely to be.
There is no one else,’ repeated Richard
Egerton, with a bitter sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>‘Don’t sigh like that, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Dickey, please, Caleb.’</p>

<p>‘Dickey, then—my little Dickey, as I
loved so hearty. To think I should have
found you again arter all these years—grow’d
to such a fine man, too—and in
that awful storm! It beats everythink I
ever heard of.’</p>

<p>‘Whatever is, is best,’ replied Egerton.
‘You won’t grumble again, will you, Caleb,
because the answer to your prayer may be
delayed a little?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t mention it, my boy. I feels
ashamed even to remember it.’</p>

<p>‘You see that even the hurricane has
borne its good fruit as well as its evil.
Without it we might never have been made
known to each other.’</p>

<p>‘It’s bin a marciful interposition of
Providence from beginning to end,’
said old Williams, wiping his eyes.
‘But I should like to see you a bit
more cheerful, Dickey. There has been
a sad look in your face the last four
days, which I couldn’t help noticin’, and
now that I knows you to be who you
are, I sha’n’t rest satisfied till you smiles in
the old way again.’</p>

<p>Egerton was just about to answer him,
when a gentle knock sounded on the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
door, which stood ajar in consequence of
the heat.</p>

<p>‘Who’s that?’ demanded the old sailor
gruffly.</p>

<p>‘It is only I,’ responded a soft, trembling
voice, which Egerton at once recognised as
that of Amy Herbert. ‘I came to inquire
how Mr Egerton is getting on, and if I can
do anything for him.’</p>

<p>‘No, miss, thank ye, you can’t do
nothin’; he’s a-goin’ on very nicely, and
I’m here,’ responded Williams.</p>

<p>‘May I speak to him for a minute?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ said Richard eagerly, raising
himself to a sitting position.</p>

<p>The young lady pushed open the cabin
door and stood on the threshold, blushing
like a rose. She looked very beautiful,
although her eyes were swollen with crying,
and her dress and hair were in
disorder.</p>

<p>‘I felt I could not sleep until I had
thanked you for what you did for me, Mr
Egerton,’ she uttered tearfully. ‘You endangered
your own life to save mine, who
have done nothing to deserve such a
sacrifice on your part.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, that he did!’ interrupted Williams.</p>

<p>‘It is nothing—nothing,’ said Egerton
faintly, for the sight of her had upset all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
his courage. ‘You could not help it. It
is not your fault if—if—’</p>

<p>‘If—<i>what</i>?’ demanded Amy Herbert.</p>

<p>He turned his eyes towards her, and a
new hope ran through his veins like a
reviving cordial. ‘Caleb, my dear old
friend,’ he exclaimed tenderly, ‘leave me
for five minutes to myself.’</p>

<p>‘What! all alone with the lady?’ returned
Caleb, regarding Miss Herbert as
though she were a dangerous animal.</p>

<p>‘Yes, for one moment only. I have
something to say for her ear alone.’</p>

<p>He had sprung off the berth in his
excitement, and was about to quit the
cabin.</p>

<p>‘Don’t go out, then, my dear boy, for
mercy’s sake,’ said Williams, ‘for you’ve
lost a deal of blood, and are weaker than
you think for. Will you promise me?’</p>

<p>‘I do promise, if you will only go.’</p>

<p>The old man shambled out of the cabin
as he spoke, and the two were left alone.</p>

<p>‘I want so much to tell you,’ said
Egerton, speaking with some difficulty,
‘what I had not the courage to say this
morning, that I know it is not your fault.
The blame rests entirely on me. It was
my presumption—my madness, if you will—that
led me on to speak to you as I did,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
and I acquit you of all blame. I know
you feel for my disappointment now—and
I thought it would make you easier to hear
this—that is all.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, if I could only make you understand!’
she sobbed.</p>

<p>‘Pray don’t distress yourself. I do understand
it all. How can you help it if
you find it impossible to love me?’</p>

<p>‘But I do not—I mean, I can—that is
to say, I did not mean—’ stammered the
girl, colouring scarlet at the admission she
had been betrayed into making.</p>

<p>‘Am I to understand that you did not
mean what you said this morning?’ exclaimed
the young man as he grasped her
hand. ‘Amy, you have given me fresh
life. Oh, do not take it back again! Say
if you love me!’</p>

<p>Her maidenly bashfulness struggled for
a moment with her probity, but the latter
conquered.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I do love you! It was my
egregious vanity and love of conquest that
made me trifle with your feelings this
morning. I have been very miserable
ever since. I have hoped you would
speak to me again, and when I saw you
risk your life for my sake, I wished that I
might have died for you instead.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>‘O Amy, Amy! Your words are opening
heaven to me. Darling, is it possible
that you will be my wife?’</p>

<p>‘If you can forgive my heartless rejection
of you, Richard. If you can believe
that I am true in saying that I hated each
word even as I uttered it. If you still
think me worthy of being your life-companion,
I will give you a very different
answer now.’</p>

<p>‘You have made me the very happiest
man on earth,’ he cried exultantly, as he
folded her in his arms.</p>

<p>‘Lor’, sir!—I mean my boy, Dickey—you
mus’n’t be a-goin’ on like this!’ exclaimed
old Caleb, appearing on the scene
when least expected. ‘The doctor’s particular
orders was that you were to keep
quiet and not bounce about.’</p>

<p>‘Caleb, my dear friend, I will be as quiet
as your heart can wish now, for mine is at
rest. Don’t stare so. Come here, and sit
down again, whilst I explain to this young
lady all that you have been to me, and tell
you all that I trust she will very soon be
to me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, we’re to have a missus arter all,
then!’ cried the old sailor meaningly.
‘Why, I thought you told me just now, my
boy, that you warn’t a-goin’ to be spliced!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>‘Ah, Caleb, the storm has sent me a wife
as it brought you a son. Had it not been
for that awful hurricane, and the peril in
which it placed this precious life, I am not
quite sure if we should ever have been so
happy as we are this evening. Never
mind my wounded arm and the gash upon
my cheek; Miss Herbert says she shall
like it all the better for a scar. The wound
in my heart is healed, Caleb, and life looks
very fair for us all henceforward. And yet
you could not believe “Old Contrairy,”’
he added playfully, that ‘Whatever is, is
best.’</p>

<p class="center">THE END.</p>

</div>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">I came down to breakfast one
morning last autumn, and found
a letter on the table from my
old friend Bessie Maclean.</p>

<p>Bessie and I were girls at school together,
and continued our intimacy after
we left, until we married and went to different
parts of the country. Marriage is
a terrible breaker up of old ties; not only
by reason of the separation which generally
ensues, but because of the new duties it
entails. We had both married the men of
our hearts, however, and in comfortable
circumstances; and so far all was well.
But little by little our correspondence,
which at first had been so voluminous and
detailed, became scanty and irregular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>Bessie had half-a-dozen children to
occupy her time and attention; and I—I
had my dear husband to fill up the measure
of my life, and felt myself a wicked and
ungrateful woman if I even wished for
more.</p>

<p>But—there is always a ‘but’ in the
happiest worldly existence, is there not?—Dick
and I had no children; and the
disappointment had sometimes caused me
to shed bitter tears. In secret though; I
had never told my husband one-half I felt
upon the subject.</p>

<p>Of course he twitted me with it sometimes
in a playful manner, which showed
that the fact did not sink very deep into
his heart, whatever it did in mine. Yet
I had thought occasionally that he looked
more thoughtful than usual when children
were in the room: and the idea made me
thoughtful too. Especially I had noticed
it when we paid our first visit to Bessie in
her new house; for I must tell you that a
few months before my story commences,
Tom Maclean had bought a large farm in
the vicinity of the town where the gaol
stands, of which my husband is the governor.
Of course, after so long a separation,
Bessie and I were delighted to find we had
become near neighbours again; and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
soon as ever the Macleans were settled,
they invited us both over to Poplar Farm,
to stand sponsors to the latest arrival—a
little boy whom they called Richard, after
my Dick, God bless him! Poplar Farm
was ten or twelve miles from Chesterwick,
however, so I had not seen my friends
more than five or six times since the
christening day; and the visits I had paid
them had not quite realised the expectations
I had formed of meeting Bessie
again.</p>

<p>I suppose it was my vile envious nature,
or perhaps the quiet life I have led with
Dick has made me selfish; but it seemed
to me as though all the time my old school-fellow
spent with me was devoted, not to
our friendship, or reminiscences of our
girlish days, but to talking about her
children and telling me of their accomplishments
or complaints, or consulting me as
to their dresses or amusements. Of course
I was pleased at first to be introduced to
her fine brood of boys and girls; but I
could hardly be expected to feel as much
interest in them as their mother did, and I
was sorely disappointed to find she had
lost so much of hers in me. She did not
seem to care to hear anything about my
husband, or how we loved each other in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
our happy, peaceful home; nor did she
even talk much about Tom, with her affection
for whom I could have sympathised
better than with any other. But he appeared
to be almost forgotten or overlooked
in her maternal care for the little ones;
and she was more anxious that Lily’s new
hat should become her, or Charley’s medicine
be swallowed without a fit of obstinacy,
than that Mr Maclean should appreciate
his dinner, or have his evening hours undisturbed
for settling his accounts. I have
observed the same thing—oh! scores of
times—amongst my married female acquaintances;
and the fact has done more
to reconcile me to the want of a family than
any other.</p>

<p>Not that I believe that the charge of a
hundred children could ever make me forget
my darling’s wants—but there, this is
not a love story, so I must try and keep
my Dick’s name out of it as much as
possible.</p>

<p>I had received several letters from Bessie
during the last month, which had rather
surprised me, as she had grown very lazy
at correspondence, as I have said before,
and naturally, taking up her residence at
Poplar Farm had not made her write
oftener, excepting when she required the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
benefit of my experience with regard to
the advantages of her new home. Her two
last letters, however, had been written in a
very unaccountable strain; and if I had not
known she was comfortably and happily
situated, I should have imagined it was
just the reverse.</p>

<p>‘Another letter from Bessie!’ I exclaimed,
as I broke the seal. ‘What on
earth can she want now? I suppose she
has found out somebody sells whiter flour
than Watkins, or better tea than Amyott?
I almost believe, Dick, she regrets having
left Lincolnshire.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know why she should,’ replied
Dick, as he commenced a raid upon the
breakfast-table; ‘for, according to Maclean’s
account, they lived in a perfect
swamp there. But why can’t the woman
look after her own flour and tea? Why is
she to worry you about everything in this
fashion?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I suppose she thinks, as I have
no children, I cannot possibly have anything
to do,’ I said, laughing; ‘for I heard
her remark, with regard to Mrs Anderson,
who is in the same plight as myself, that it
must be quite a charity to give her any
employment!’</p>

<p>‘Like her impudence,’ growled Dick—(I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
don’t think Bessie is a favourite with my
husband; perhaps I talked too much about
her beforehand),—‘I should let her know
to the contrary if I were you, Dolly. I
believe, with all her fuss and bustle, that
you do twice her work in half the time.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! I have only <i>one</i> baby to look after,
you see, though he’s a big one,’ I said, as
I gave his head a squeeze with my disengaged
hand; ‘but goodness me, Dick, this
letter is worse than the last even. Bessie
seems really in low spirits now. She
says that Mr Maclean’s business will take
him away from home for a few nights next
week, and she wants me to go over and
spend them with her in—yes, she actually
calls Poplar Farm—“this gloomy ramshackle
old place.”’</p>

<p>‘It’s old enough,’ said Dick, ‘and all
the better for it; but it’s not “ramshackle.”
Better walls and roof were never built
than those of Poplar Farm. It stands as
steady as the gaol.’</p>

<p>‘But about my going to her, Dick—can
you spare me?’</p>

<p>‘Can I spare you!’ repeated my husband
in that tone of voice that, after ten
years’ marriage, has still the power to
make my heart beat faster. ‘Of course I
can! I could spare you for good and all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
if someone would only be obliging enough
to take you off my hands; but there’s no
such luck in store for me. Only mind the
days don’t stretch themselves into weeks,
sweetheart!’</p>

<p>‘Into weeks!’ I replied, indignantly.
‘Have I ever stayed weeks away from
you yet, Dick? I’m not even sure that I
shall go at all.’</p>

<p>‘Yes! you’d better go, Dolly; Bessie
Maclean is selfish and egotistical, and
somewhat of a fool; but I daresay she’s
nervous at the idea of remaining in that
isolated home by herself, particularly as it
is all so strange to her. And you don’t
know what fear is, old woman!’</p>

<p>‘I wish she could overhear the character
you give her,’ I answered, laughingly.
But Dick was right. I am <i>not</i> a nervous
woman, and if I had been, he would have
cured me of it long before. Living in a
gaol, and having, of my own free will,
constant access to the prisoners, had
effectually dispersed any ladylike unreasonable
fears I may once have thought
womanly and becoming, and made me
ashamed of starting at shadows. So, having
sent an affirmative answer to my
friend’s appeal, I set out for Poplar Farm,
when the time came, with as much confidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
in my powers of protection as
though I had been of the sterner sex.</p>

<p>Dick drove me over in the curricle.</p>

<p>It was a bright November morning:
one of those days when the air is crisp
and exhilarating without being in the least
degree cold; a day on which one feels
younger, and more hopeful and capable of
good—on which one’s sorrows seem too
paltry for consideration, and one’s happiness
far more than one deserves. I experienced
this sensation in the fullest
sense, as I crept as close as I could to
my husband’s side, and smuggled one hand
beneath his arm.</p>

<p>‘Holloa!’ cried Dick; ‘why, what’s
this? Repenting of your promise already,
eh? Oh! you spoony woman, I’m
ashamed of you!’</p>

<p>I <i>was</i> repenting it, but I did not tell
him so. It is good for people who love
very much to part sometimes, if only to
teach them how great a blessing they
possess in each other’s affection.</p>

<p>As we drove up the long-neglected
drive of Poplar Farm, I could not help
thinking that Bessie was right in considering
it gloomy. The sun had disappeared
again behind an autumn cloud.
The trees had shed most of their leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
which lay in sodden heaps along the paths,
and a chilly wind had commenced to blow.
I drew my cloak closer against my shoulders,
and told Dick what I thought.</p>

<p>‘Nonsense, Dolly!’ he replied. ‘The
place is well enough; and when Maclean
has had time to put it in order, will be
one of the prettiest farms in the county.
I only wish I had the money to buy such
another. But naturally it does not look
its best when the trees are bare.’</p>

<p>‘Stop!’ I cried, suddenly; ‘there’s the
baby. Let me get down and kiss him.
That must be the new nurse carrying him,
Dick. But what a lugubrious looking
young person she is!’</p>

<p>My husband had good-naturedly drawn
up by this time, and I had scrambled
down to meet my little godson, who was
about three months old. But as soon as
I had pulled aside the veil that covered
his face, I started with surprise.</p>

<p>‘Oh! how he <i>has</i> gone off!’ I exclaimed.</p>

<p>The baby, who had been so fat and
dimpled and red-faced last time I saw him,
was now drawn and white and thin. The
change was apparent so that even Dick
could see it from the box-seat.</p>

<p>‘Whew!’ he whistled; ‘why, what’s the
matter with the little chap—is he ill?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>‘Oh no! he’s not ill. He is perfectly well.
You don’t think he looks ill, madam?’ said
the girl who was carrying him, anxiously.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think I ever saw a child so
changed in my life,’ I answered, in my
blunt fashion. ‘Are you the wet-nurse
Mrs Maclean told me she had engaged
for him?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, madam,’ she said, in a very low
voice.</p>

<p>I raised my eyes, and examined her
then for the first time thoroughly; and I
could not help observing what a remarkable-looking
girl she was. She had the
very palest and clearest of complexions—so
colourless that it looked like the finest
white wax, and her skin was of the texture
of satin. Her large, clear, grey eyes,
which shone with a limpid light, like
agates with water running over them, had
a startled look, which might almost have
been mistaken for fear, and her delicately
cut mouth drooped in the most pathetic
manner. To add to the mournfulness of
her appearance, her hair was almost completely
hidden beneath her cap, and her
dress was the deepest widow’s mourning.
I made a few indifferent remarks about
the child, kissed it, and jumped up to my
seat again. The nurse was not the person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
I felt to whom to speak on the subject
of the baby’s appearance. She made a
deep reverence as the carriage moved off,
and I saw she was a very superior sort of
young woman; but of what account was
that, where little Dick’s health, and perhaps
his life, was concerned?</p>

<p>‘Bessie’s a greater fool than I took her
for,’ I exclaimed, indignantly, as we drove
on towards the house.</p>

<p>‘What’s in the wind now?’ said Dick.</p>

<p>‘Fancy, choosing a wet-nurse for a
baby all crape and bombazine and tears.
Why, that girl looks as if she cried night
and day. I knew Bessie had been weak
enough to be persuaded by the doctor to
give up nursing baby herself, but she
might have exercised a little discretion in
the choice of a substitute. The child is
half the size he was last month.’</p>

<p>‘What a lot we know about babies!’
said Dick, in his chaffing way.</p>

<p>‘I should hope I know more than half
the mothers I meet,’ I continued, with
some warmth. ‘I should be ashamed to
be as ignorant as Bessie herself, for instance,
though she <i>has</i> had six children,’
I added, with a little droop in my voice.</p>

<p>‘My own Dolly!’ said Dick, fondly;
and when he says those words in that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
voice, I don’t care for anything else in all
the wide, wide world. He wouldn’t stay—even
to dismount from his box, for we
knew Mr Maclean had already left the
house, and he thought our chatter would
get on better without him, added to which
he had duties demanding him at home.
So I gave him one long, long kiss, and
let him go; and as soon as he was out
of sight, turned into the door of Poplar
Farm.</p>

<p>Bessie was in the dining-room, where
the dinner was already spread, surrounded
by her batch of self-willed unruly children.
As she came forward to meet me, I saw
that she looked tired and worn out, and
that her dress was untidy and neglected.</p>

<p>‘It is so good of you to come, Dolly,’
was her greeting, ‘for I am so worried I
don’t know what I should have done without
you.’</p>

<p>‘I am very glad to be of use, Bessie;
but what worries you—the baby?’</p>

<p>‘Dear me! no. It is something quite
different. Why should baby worry me?
He has his wet-nurse, and she takes him
completely off my hands.’</p>

<p>‘He is so pulled down,’ I said unhesitatingly,
for I took an interest in my little
godson. ‘I met him just now in the drive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
and hardly recognised the child. Are you
satisfied his nurse does him justice?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, perfectly so. She is a most estimable
young woman, so quiet and ladylike
in her way of speaking. Did you notice
her eyes? such a remarkable colour; and
her hands are as white as yours or mine.’</p>

<p>‘But the baby does not appear to be
thriving. He can’t inherit her eyes or her
hands, you know, and if he could, I don’t
see that they would be much use to him.
What’s her name? Where did you find
her?’</p>

<p>‘She’s a Mrs Graham; and she was
recommended to me from the Lying-in
Hospital at Chesterwick. I’m sorry you
don’t think baby looks well. Perhaps the
change has pulled him down a little, though
I really can’t see it myself.’</p>

<p>I daresay she did not. Bessie is that
sort of woman that never will see anything
until it has actually occurred. If her
children died, she would make as great a
fuss over them—perhaps more—than mothers
who have guarded theirs from their
infancy upwards; yet she will let them eat
improper food, and get damp feet, and
remain out in the burning sun without any
covering to their heads; and if you remonstrate
with her, her invariable excuse is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
that they have always done so before and
got no harm. As if the fact of a wrong
being permitted should make it a right;
or because we have fallen from the top of
a house once without injury, we may cast
ourselves thence headlong each day without
impunity.</p>

<p>I really never did think, when Bessie
and I were girls together, that she would
turn out such a ninny.</p>

<p>‘What <i>has</i> worried you then, since it is
not the baby?’ I demanded presently.</p>

<p>‘Hush! I can’t tell you before the
children. It’s an awful business, and I
wouldn’t have them hear of it for worlds.
Will you lay your bonnet aside, and have
dinner with us as you are? or I’m afraid it
may get cold. Lily—Charley—Tommy,
lay down these toys, and come to the table
at once. Put Bessie up on her high chair;
and somebody go and call Annie. Ah!
Dolly, my dear, how well you have kept
your figure! What would I not give to
be as slim and neat as you are.’</p>

<p>And although, of course, I would not
compare one advantage with the other,
yet I must say that the pleasures of having
a family would possess a great drawback to
me, if I were compelled at the same time
to become as rotund and untidy in appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
as poor Bessie is at present. And I
believe the chief thing Tom Maclean fell
in love with was her pretty rounded little
figure. Alas! alas!</p>

<p>But I am keeping the early dinner waiting.
As soon as it was despatched, with
the usual accompaniments of cutting up
the children’s meat, wiping their mouths,
and preventing their throwing the tumblers
at each other’s heads, Mrs Maclean rose
and offered to show me to my bedroom.
It was next to her own, and communicated
with it by a door.</p>

<p>‘This dear old place!’ I exclaimed as I
entered it; ‘you are making it very pretty,
Bessie. Aren’t you glad that you have
come into such a handsome property, instead
of having been stuck down in a modern
villa, with the plaster on the walls
only half-dry?’</p>

<p>But Bessie did not appear to appreciate
my congratulations.</p>

<p>‘Dolly,’ she said, as she sunk down into
a chair, ‘I would change Poplar Farm for
the poorest little villa that was ever built.’</p>

<p>‘My dear girl, what do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Mean!</i> That the house is haunted,
Dolly—’</p>

<p>I confess it; I could not help it: I burst
into the loudest and rudest laugh imaginable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>Poplar Farm haunted! What an absurdly
unreasonable idea! Why, the last
tenants had only just moved out in time
to let the Macleans come in, and the house
had been freshly papered and painted from
basement to attic. There was not a nook
nor a corner for a ghost to hide in.</p>

<p>I could not help laughing; and what is
worse, I could not stop laughing, until my
friend was offended.</p>

<p>‘You may laugh as much as you like,’
she said at last; ‘but I have told you
nothing but the truth. Do you mean to
say that you consider such a thing impossible?’</p>

<p>‘No! I won’t go as far as that; but I
think it is very uncommon, and very unlikely
to occur to—to—to—’</p>

<p>Here I was obliged to halt, for the only
words I could think of were, ‘to anyone so
material as yourself;’ and I couldn’t quite
say that. For though I do not deny the
possibility of apparitions, I believe that the
person who is capable of perceiving them
must be composed of more mind than
matter, and there is nothing spiritual nor
æsthetic about poor Bessie.</p>

<p>‘What is the ghost like, and who has
seen it?’ I demanded, as soon as I could
command my countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>‘Several of the servants and myself,’
replied Bessie; ‘and Tom might have seen
it, too, if he were not so lazy. But one
night when the noises were close to our
door, he refused to rouse himself even to
listen to them, and told me to go—Well,
dear, I really can’t repeat what he said;
but husbands do not always use the politest
language when out of temper, you know!’</p>

<p>‘Noises! Then the ghost has been
heard as well as seen?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes! and such mournful noises,
too. Such weeping and wailing, enough
to break one’s heart. The first time I
saw it, Dolly, I thought I should have
died of fright.’</p>

<p>‘Tell me all about it.’</p>

<p>‘I had been sitting up late one Saturday
night mending the children’s socks for
Sunday, and Tom had been in bed for a
good two hours. Everybody was in bed
but myself, and I thought, as I carried my
single candle up the dark staircase, how
silent and ghastly everything appeared.
As I turned into the corridor, I heard a
gasping sound like a stifled sob. At first
I could hardly believe my ears; but when
it was repeated, my heart seemed to stand
still. I was hesitating whether to go back
or forward, and trembling in every limb,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
when <span class="smcap">it</span>—this dreadful <span class="smcap">thing</span>—crossed
me. It sprung up, I don’t know from
where, in the darkness, and just looked at
me once and rushed away. I nearly sunk
to the ground, as you may well imagine.
I had only just time to get inside my own
door, when I tumbled right across the bed,
and Tom had to get up and pick up the
candlestick, and help undress me; and
really, by the way he went on about it,
you’d have thought it was all my fault.’</p>

<p>‘What was <span class="smcap">it</span> like? that is the main
thing, Bessie.’</p>

<p>‘My dear, you don’t suppose I looked
at it more than I was absolutely obliged.
I know <span class="smcap">it</span> was dressed all in white, with
snow-white hair hanging over its face, and
fearful staring eyes. It’s a perfect wonder
to me I stand alive here now.’</p>

<p>‘And it has been seen since then?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, several times, and we hear <span class="smcap">it</span> every
night as regularly as possible about two
o’clock in the morning. The cook has
seen it—so has the housemaid; and not a
servant amongst them would fetch a glass
of water from downstairs after ten o’clock,
if we were all dying for want of it.’</p>

<p>‘A pleasant state of affairs,’ I ejaculated;
‘and will you take no steps to investigate
the mystery, and dissolve the household
fears?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>‘What steps could I take?’</p>

<p>‘Sit up for the apparition, and speak to
it; and if it won’t answer, take hold of it
and see if it is flesh and blood or air.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Dolly, I would rather die.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I hope you’ll wake me up when
the sounds begin to-night,’ I answered,
‘for I am curious to hear them.’</p>

<p>But I didn’t tell Bessie that I would be
the one to ‘bell the cat;’ for, though I
have little fear, I have no foolhardiness;
and if her ghost turned out to be a real
one, I had no wish to interfere with it.</p>

<p>In the evening, as much with a view of
pointing out the baby’s condition to Bessie
as for any other reason, I asked her to
accompany me to the nursery, and see him
put to bed. I found that he slept in a
room alone with his wet-nurse, who was
engaged in bathing the little creature as
we entered. Mrs Graham looked very
pretty and delicate as she bent over the
bath, attending to the child; but I observed
that she never once smiled at nor played
with him, as nurses usually do with infants
during the process of washing. Little
Dick was certainly very attenuated and
languid, and even his mother seemed to
observe it when pointed out to her. Mrs
Graham listened to our conversation with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
rather an anxious expression on her countenance,
and I thought by drawing her out
we might gain some clue to the baby’s ill
health.</p>

<p>‘Is your own child strong and vigorous?’
I asked her.</p>

<p>‘My own child is dead, madam,’ she
replied.</p>

<p>‘It was your first, I presume? You
appear very young.’</p>

<p>‘It was my first. I was twenty last
birthday.’</p>

<p>She seemed unwilling to be more communicative,
and I did not like to enter
directly on the subject of her husband’s
death. Poor child! she might have loved
him as I did Dick. So, as Bessie had
sauntered into the general nursery and left
us alone together, I ventured to sound her
on another matter, which I thought might
be having a secret effect upon her.</p>

<p>‘Have you seen anything of this apparition
the servants speak of, Mrs Graham?’</p>

<p>‘No, madam,’ she replied, quietly.</p>

<p>‘It is very foolish of people to be frightened
of they really don’t know what; but
no one seems to have been brave enough
to try and find out the reason of the mysterious
noises heard at night here. You
have heard them, perhaps?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>‘No, madam,’ she said again, without
further comment.</p>

<p>‘Would it alarm you to see or hear it?’ I
had forced her now to say something in reply.</p>

<p>‘I think not,’ she answered, ‘I think if
spirits can come back from the dead, they
must do so only in sympathy with those
they have left behind; and, if that is possible,
and I thought this one came for me,
I should only be too thankful to have a
glimpse of its face, or to hear the sound of
its voice. I think those people who have
so much fear of spirits can never have
known what it is to lose any one they
would lay down their lives to follow wherever
it might lead them.’</p>

<p>She spoke in a low, mournful cadence
that touched my heart. Poor girl! she
was thinking of her husband and her own
desolate condition. I felt for and sympathised
with her, and before I left the nursery
I took her thin hand and pressed it. She
looked surprised, but I had only to say,
‘I love my own husband as my life,’ to see
the tears run into her eyes, and to know
she understood me. Still she was by no
means a proper person to perform the part
of a mother towards little Dick, and I resolved
before I left Poplar Farm to try and
persuade Bessie to change her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>The rest of the day passed rather monotonously.
I worked at one of Dick’s
shirts, and wondered how I ever could
have thought Bessie such a charming companion,
whilst she alternatively indulged
and scolded her very unpleasant young
family. At last they were all despatched
to bed, and as soon as decency would permit,
I yawned and said I should like to
follow their example. So we were all
packed away by ten o’clock, my last act
having been to pay a visit to Mrs Graham’s
room, where I had left her fast asleep with
my little godson tucked in snugly on her
arm. Bessie lay awake for some time
talking of the celebrated ghost, but I was
too sleepy to be a good listener, and am
afraid I dropped off in the midst of her
recital. When I waked again, it was by
dint of feeling her shake my arm.</p>

<p>‘Dolly! Dolly!’ she was exclaiming, in
a low, hurried voice. ‘Listen! there is the
sound, and close against the door.’</p>

<p class="center"><i>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</i></p>

of reading from the pen of Miss Florence Marryat.”—<i>John Bull.</i></p>

<p>“The three volumes will be read through with avidity.”—<i>Court Journal.</i></p>

<p>“‘My Sister the Actress’ is infinitely above the average run of novels....
A skilfully told and remarkably interesting story which will add
to Miss Marryat’s reputation.”—<i>Court Circular.</i></p>

<p>“The tone of the book is distinctly wholesome.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“It is both clever and amusing.”—<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“Everywhere it is fresh, lively, and thoughtful.”—<i>Public Opinion.</i></p>

<p>“The characters are drawn with great power.... The story is one
of unusual interest and ought to secure a great number of readers.”—<i>Sunday Times.</i></p>

<p>“We can fully recommend the book to our readers as being thoroughly
interesting and cleverly written.”—<i>Sylvia’s Home Journal.</i></p>

<p>“A really charming story, full of delicate pathos and quiet humour,

<p class="book">* SWEETHEART AND WIFE. By <span class="smcap">Lady Constance
Howard</span>, Author of “Mollie Darling,”
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“The story from first to last is attractive, and cannot fail to command
wide favour.... There is, indeed, throughout the whole of the
story a most unusual power, not only of language but of imagination,
and the tender pathos, which is introduced in no laboured fashion,
adds a charm which it is difficult to describe, but impossible for the
reader not to appreciate.”—<i>Whitehall Review.</i></p>

<p>“There is a genuine flavour of the old-fashioned romance in it which
is too frequently lacking in what may be termed the latter-day novel.”—<i>Court Circular.</i></p>

<p>“‘Sweetheart and Wife’ is a love idyll, skilfully painted in the
midst of many people and many scenes, described by one who writes
with that very rare attribute of the modern novelist—knowledge of,
and familiarity with, the society she pictures.”—<i>Life.</i></p>

<p>“So many pretentious people write stupidly and ignorantly of
fashionable life that it is a real pleasure to come across a novel by one who
is thoroughly familiar with Society and all its little vanities. From
this point of view ‘Sweetheart and Wife’ is a book which is likely to
be in great demand at the circulating libraries for some time to come.
It is a love story, told with charming simplicity and not a little power.
Many of the descriptions are full of picturesque beauty, the dialogue is
strikingly natural, and the plot is consistently and cleverly developed.”—<i>Society.</i></p>

<p>“Compared with the former works of the authoress of ‘The Queen

<p>“The freshness, the purity, the simplicity of style, the truth and the
directness of purpose which always characterise Mrs. Eiloart’s novels

<p class="center"><i>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</i></p>

<p>“Told with much pathos and power.”—<i>Era.</i></p>

<p>“We can say for ourselves that we have read its three hundred pages
with unfailing interest.”—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p>“It is an interesting story, and thoroughly well worth the perusal
of all who have the welfare at Ireland and the Irish honestly at heart.”—<i>Sunday Times.</i></p>

<p>“Intimate knowledge of the national character is shown by the
writer, who inscribes her book to Mr. Forster in earnest and somewhat
impulsive language.”—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>“Miss Harriett Jay is already so well known to the public as a perfect
mistress of style, that we need bestow no greater praise upon the little
volume before us than by saying that in this respect it fully justifies the
reputation acquired by the author of ‘The Queen of Connaught.’...
Is well and boldly written.”—<i>Court Journal.</i></p>

<p>“Miss Jay paints with graphic power the scenes of the story, and
some of her descriptions of events and incidents are most vigorous and
refreshing in their terse eloquence.”—<i>Nonconformist.</i></p>

<p>“Any one who wishes to realise the mischief which may be done by
the ceaseless plotting of the Catholic priests cannot do better than read
‘The Priest’s Blessing.’”—<i>Lloyd’s.</i></p>

<p>“The novel is certain to attract exceptional attention.”—<i>Graphic.</i></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Will be read through with avidity.”—<i>Court Journal.</i></p>

<p>“‘My Sister the Actress’ is infinitely above the average run of novels.
A skilfully told and remarkably interesting story which will add

<p>“The tone of the book is distinctly wholesome.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p class="book">AN INNOCENT SINNER. By <span class="smcap">Mabel Collins</span>,
Author of “Too Red a Dawn,” “In the Flower of
Her Youth,” &amp;c. In picture boards, 2s.; post free,
2s. 4d.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Miss Collins, who writes with correctness and vigour, has chosen
in ‘An Innocent Sinner’ to rely for interest on an entirely new combination
of circumstances. This ... is elaborated with some skill.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“Thinkers, who are not too wise in their own conceit, will give the
book a much higher place in their esteem than is usually accorded to
a work of fiction.... The book is one that ought to be both read and
studied.”—<i>Whitehall Review.</i></p>

<p>“Decidedly remarkable, and very well worth reading.”—<i>Morning
Post.</i></p>

<p>“Of peculiar originality and power.... For her freedom from extravagance
in dealing with a topic which makes extravagance an
almost irresistible temptation, Miss Collins must be especially commended.”—<i>Globe.</i></p>

<p>“Must certainly be acquitted of any tendency to the conventional
or commonplace—the besetting sin of the novelists of the day....
The situation is, no doubt, a delicate one, but we do not think the
author’s treatment of it can be fairly objected to on the score of propriety
or good taste.”—<i>Graphic.</i></p>

<p>“There are both prettiness and ingenuity in the novel which
Miss Mabel Collins, the clever daughter of a gifted father, has
written—‘An Innocent Sinner.’ There is a grace and a power, as well
as a strangeness, about the book which will secure for it many
readers.”—<i>World.</i></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“The story from first to last is attractive, and cannot fail to command
wide favour.... There is, indeed, throughout the whole of the
story a most unusual power, not only of language but of imagination,
and the tender pathos, which is introduced in no laboured fashion,
adds a charm which it is difficult to describe, but impossible for the
reader not to appreciate.”—<i>Whitehall Review.</i></p>

<p>“There is a genuine flavour of the old-fashioned romance in it which
is too frequently lacking in what may be termed the latter-day novel.”—<i>Court Circular.</i></p>

<span class="smcap">Mabel Collins</span>, Author of “Too Red a Dawn,”
“An Innocent Sinner,” &amp;c. 3 vols.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“Miss Collins’s ably-written story is likely to be well received.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“Miss Collins is acquiring more strength and facility as she continues
in authorship. The tale before us has some well-conceived situations.”—<i>Academy.</i></p>

<p>“Miss Collins has evidently thrown her whole heart into her work,
for many passages are full of eloquence and fire. The pathetic scenes
are composed with a power of detail that in many cases will thrill the
reader. Engrossing as are the first and second volumes, the third far
excels either.... Miss Collins is the author of several stories of
fiction, for which she has obtained the good opinion of her admirers,
but ‘In the Flower of Her Youth’ far excels her former efforts.”—<i>Public
Opinion.</i></p>

<p>“Miss Collins may certainly be congratulated on having maintained,
so far as the story itself is concerned, the originality of style which
distinguishes her previous books.”—<i>John Bull.</i></p>

<p>“Brough, however, is sketched with so much fidelity that the
portrait will certainly be recognised by those who remember the
brilliant, genial, and jovial original who, not so many years ago, used
to shoulder his way along Fleet-street and the Strand, and was once,
by the way, a familiar figure in the streets of Nottingham.... The
description of Siena is charming—a complete picture without dry
detailed literalness, and replete with poetic feeling. ‘In the Flower
of Her Youth’ is in almost all respects an able, and in many respects a
powerful, book.”—<i>Nottingham Daily Guardian.</i></p>

<p>“‘Facing the Footlights,’ as its name indicates, is highly melodramatic.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
